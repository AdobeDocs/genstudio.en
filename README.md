# Contribute article

We welcome contributions from our community as well as from Adobe employees from outside the documentation teams.

## Adobe Open Source Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the [Adobe Open Source Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) or the [.NET Foundation Code of Conduct](https://dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct). For more information, see the [Contributing](contributing.md) article.

## How to contribute to Adobe content

**If you are not an Adobe employee** you can submit an external community contribution. Community contributions are imported to our internal systems and are edited and merged in the public repo. The public repo is then synced with the latest changes and merged in the private repository.

**If you are an Adobe employee**, you can contribute directly to the private [Adobe GitHub repository](https://git.corp.adobe.com/AdobeDocs/). For details, see the Adobe Experience League Authoring Guide for Adobe employees.

## External contributors

### Minor changes

If you are contributing a minor update:

1. Navigate to the topic you want to edit.
1. In the "Was this content helpful?" banner that appears at the bottom of your browser window click **Detailed feedback options**.
1. Click **Suggest an edit** and submit a pull request (PR) with your changes in GitHub UI.

   See the general [Adobe Docs contributor guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/contributor/contributor-guide/introduction.html) for more information.

Minor corrections or clarifications you submit for documentation and code examples in this repo are covered by the Adobe terms of use.

### Major changes or new topics from the community

If you're part of the Adobe community and want to create a new topic or submit major changes, use the **Issues** tab in the applicable Git repository to submit an issue to start a conversation with the documentation team. Once a plan is agreed upon, you will work with an Adobe writer to publish your revisions.

**NOTE:** If you submit a pull request with significant changes to documentation and code examples, you'll see a message in the pull request asking you to submit an online contribution license agreement (CLA). We need you to complete the online form before we can review your pull request.

### Tools

Community contributors can use the GitHub UI for basic editing or fork the repo to make major contributions.

See the [Adobe Docs Contributor Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/contributor/contributor-guide/introduction.html) for details.

## Internal contributors

If you are a technical writer, program manager, or developer from the product team for an Adobe Experience Cloud solution and it's your job to contribute to or author technical articles, use the [private repository](https://git.corp.adobe.com/AdobeDocs).
