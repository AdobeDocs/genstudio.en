# Create an email experience

This tutorial demonstrates how to generate branded email experiences using GenStudio [[!DNL Create]](/help/user-guide/create/overview.md) (paintbrush icon in the left navigation area).

To create an effective email experience, it is recommended that you [add guidelines to GenStudio](/help/user-guide/guidelines/add-guidelines.md) and brush up on the [basics of crafting a prompt](/help/user-guide/effective-prompts.md) before you begin.

## Choose a template

To get started creating a new email experience, use an available template to provide the framework for your content.

**To choose an email template**:

1. In _[!DNL Create]_, click **[!UICONTROL Email]** in the _"What do you want to create today?"_ section.
1. In the _Select template_ view, toggle the _Channels_ filter to **[!UICONTROL Email]**.
1. Use the search option, adjacent to _Filter_, to find a specific email template.
1. Click to select an email template, or toggle select multiple email templates, and click **[!UICONTROL Use]**. If you select multiple templates, when the variants are generated all selected templates will be used to provide you options.

   The Canvas, the epicenter of content creation, appears.

## Add parameters

Adding guidelines parameters supercharges the content generation process and is an integral preparatory step for generating an email experience.

**To add parameters and assets**:

1. Click the _Parameters_ icon to expand the parameters options and add references parameters and assets.
1. In the _Parameters_ section, select guidelines—Brand, Persona, and Product—to inform content creation.

   If there are no brands, personas, or products available from these menus, [add guidelines to your GenStudio](/help/user-guide/guidelines/add-guidelines.md).

1. In the _Content_ section, add content to be used in the experience *and* to influence content generation. There are three ways to add assets:
   * Click **[!UICONTROL Select from content]** to select assets (images or video) already published to [!DNL Content]. Use the filters to further narrow your search results.
   * Click **[!UICONTROL Upload]** to browse your files and choose assets to use. Along with browsing your device, you can also import from Microsoft OneDrive or Dropbox.
   * Drag and drop assets into the _Content_ section.

   When you select assets from GenStudio content, you are choosing from assets already saved to [[!DNL Content]](/help/user-guide/content/overview.md). You can filter by channel, product, language, and more, to find the needed assets quickly.

When you are done adding parameters, you can collapse the *Parameters* and *Content* sections by clicking the _Parameters_ icon again.

## Use a prompt

After guidelines are selected, craft a prompt using natural language to start generating content for your new email experience.

See [Write effective prompts](/help/user-guide/effective-prompts.md) to learn more about writing prompts.

**To use a prompt**:

1. Enter a prompt in the _"Describe the experiences you want to generate"_ prompt box.
   <!-- If the prompt box is not visible, click **[!UICONTROL Open to prompt]** to expand it. -->

<!-- 1. Optionally, click one of the prompt suggestions visible just above the prompt text box. Clicking a suggestion auto-fills the suggested prompt in the prompt box. -->
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Generate]**.

By default, four generated variations—all fueled by the prompt, guidelines, and content you added—are shown in the Canvas.

## Revise generated emails

Before selecting what to send for approval or publishing to [!DNL Content] you can edit email fragments or delete a variant from the set of generated emails.

**To revise generated variants**:

* **To manually edit an email**, double-click into any of the email fragments (such as the subject line, header, or body copy) and edit as needed.

   The subject line and preheader only require a single click to edit, while the header, body copy, and call to action require a double-click.

* **To delete an email**, click to select the email title (for example, "Email 1/4") and click **[!UICONTROL Delete variant]**.

## Verify brand alignment

To optimize the generated emails and ensure strict adherence to brand identity, leverage the power of the [_Brand guidelines check_](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md#brand-guidelines-check)—providing a summary of brand alignment for a variant—and the [_Brand validation panel_](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md#brand-validation-panel)—displaying comprehensive brand validation details and illuminating improvement areas.

You can manually edit individual email fragments or [generate refined variants](/help/user-guide/create/generate-variants.md) of the initial result to achieve alignment with your brand.

**To verify brand alignment**:

1. Click the [**[!UICONTROL [!DNL Brand] guidelines check]**](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md#brand-guidelines-check) icon for a variant and see a summary of how that variant performs when checked against your brand.
1. To get the details of the fragments and guidelines that need improvement, click **[!UICONTROL Review]** _or_ click the Brand validation icon in top menu bar to open the [_Brand validation panel_](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md#brand-validation-panel).

1. Toggle through each email to see how you can improve the generated content to be more brand-aligned.
1. [Manually revise emails](#revise-generated-emails), or [generate variants](/help/user-guide/create/generate-variants.md), to ensure your emails are closely aligned with your brand.

See [Brand validation](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md).

## Get reviews and approvals

Use the Approvals panel, accessible on the top menu bar of the Canvas, to obtain reviews, track review comments, and get approvals from stakeholders.

**To obtain reviews and approvals**:

1. [Launch an approval request](/help/user-guide/approvals/request-review.md) to solicit an [approval of drafted email experiences](/help/user-guide/approvals/approve-content.md).
1. [Remove or add reviewers](/help/user-guide/approvals/review-and-edit.md#manage-approvals) during the review process.
1. [Access the content for review](/help/user-guide/approvals/review-and-edit.md#access-content-for-review) and view the requests for revision.
1. Edit the drafts per review comments and [publish your email experiences](#publish-and-export-experience).

See [Reviews and approvals](/help/user-guide/approvals/overview.md) for more information.

## Publish and export experience

To make the generated emails available for current and future use, publish it to [!UICONTROL Content] and export it for use in your marketing campaigns.

1. **To publish your new email experience(s)**, click **[!UICONTROL Publish]** in the top toolbar.
1. **To export your new email experience(s)**, click **[!UICONTROL Export]** in the top toolbar.
   1. Select the format—CSV and images or HTML only—and click **[!UICONTROL Export]**.

See [[!DNL Content]](/help/user-guide/content/overview.md#search-and-find-approved-content) for more information.
