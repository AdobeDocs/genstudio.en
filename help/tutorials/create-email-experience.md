# Create an email experience

In GenStudio's [[!DNL Create] mode](/help/user-guide/create/overview.md), you can efficiently generate branded email experiences using Adobe's generative AI and customizable brand references.

Creating a new email experience in GenStudio is a seamless and comprehensive process that combines efficiency with powerful features.

1. [**Select an existing template**](#choose-template).
1. **[Add parameters](#add-parameters) and a [prompt](#use-a-prompt)** to customize the generation process.
1. [**Revise—edit or delete—generated email variants**](#revise-generated-emails).
1. [**Employ the built-in brand validation**](#verify-brand-alignment) to ensure consistency and brand adherence.
1. [**Seek reviews and approvals**](#review-and-approval) from stakeholders.
1. [**Publish the email experience**](#publish-experience) to [!DNL Content] and [**export it for use**](#export-experience).

In the left navigation area, click **Create** to begin creating an email experience.

## Choose a template

To get started creating a new email experience, use an available template to provide the framework for your content.

**To choose an email template:**

1. In _[!DNL Create]_ mode, click **[!UICONTROL Email]** in the _"What do you want to create today?"_ section.
1. Click to open a template in the _Recent templates_ section, or click **[!UICONTROL View all templates]** to see more available templates.
   1. In the _Select template_ pane, toggle the _Channels_ filter to **[!UICONTROL Email]**.
   1. Use the search option, adjacent to _Filter_, to find a specific email template.
   1. Click to select an email template, or toggle select multiple email templates, and click **[!UICONTROL Use]**. If you select multiple templates, when the variants are generated all selected templates will be used to provide you options.

   The Canvas, the epicenter of content creation, appears.

## Add parameters

Adding reference parameters supercharges the content generation process and is an integral preparatory step for creating a new email experience.

**To add parameters—brand references and images:**

1. Click the _Parameters_ icon IMG to begin adding references parameters and image content.
1. In the _Parameters_ section, add brand references—Brand, Product, and Persona—to inform content creation.

   If there are no brands, personas, or products available from these menus, [add brand references to your GenStudio](/help/user-guide/references/add-references.md).

1. In the _Content_ section, add content to be used in the experience *and* to influence content generation.
   1. Click **[!UICONTROL Select content]** or drop files in the _Content_ section.
   1. **[!UICONTROL Browse your device]** or **[!UICONTROL Select from GenStudio content]** to choose images to use.

   When you select images from GenStudio content, you are choosing from images already saved to [[!DNL Content]](/help/user-guide/content/overview.md). You can filter by channel, product, language, and more, to find the needed images quickly.

When you are done adding parameters, you can collapse the *Parameters* and *Content* sections by clicking the _Parameters_ icon again.

## Use a prompt

After brand references are selected, craft a prompt using natural language to start generating content for your new email experience.

See [Write effective prompts](/help/user-guide/effective-prompts.md) to learn more about writing prompts.

**To use a prompt:**

1. Enter a prompt in the _"Describe the experiences you want to generate"_ prompt box.

   If the prompt box is not visible, click **[!UICONTROL Open to prompt]** to expand it.

1. Optionally, click one of the prompt suggestions visible just above the prompt text box. Clicking a suggestion auto-fills the suggested prompt in the prompt box.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Generate]**.

By default, four generated variations—all fueled by the prompt, reference parameters, and images you added—are shown in the Canvas.

## Revise generated emails

Before selecting what to send for approval or publish to Content you can edit email fragments or delete a variant from the set of generated emails.

**To revise generated variants:**

* **To manually edit an email**, double-click into any of the email fragments (such as the subject line, header, or body copy) and edit as needed.

   The subject line and preheader only require a single click to edit, while the header, body copy, and CTA require a double-click.

* **To delete an email**, click to select the email title (for example, "Email 1/4") and click **[!UICONTROL Delete variant]**.

## Verify brand alignment

To optimize the generated emails and ensure strict adherence to brand identity, leverage the power of the [Brand Validation pane](/help/user-guide/references/brand-validation.md#brand-validation-panel). The Brand Validation pane illuminate areas for improvement. You can manually edit individual email fragments or [generate refined variants](/help/user-guide/create/generate-variants.md) of the initial result to achieve unparalleled alignment with your brand.

**To verify brand alignment using the Brand Validation panel:**

1. Open the brand validation panel and toggle through each email to see how the generated content is checked against your brand references and other GenStudio guidelines.
1. [Manually revise emails](#revise-generated-emails), or [generate variants](/help/user-guide/create/generate-variants.md), to ensure your emails are closely aligned with your brand.

See [Brand validation](/help/user-guide/references/brand-validation.md) for more information.

## Review and approval

## Publish and export experience

To make the generated emails available for current and future use, publish it to GenStudio [!UICONTROL Content] and export it for use in your marketing campaigns.

1. **To publish your new email experience(s)**, click **[!UICONTROL Publish]** in the top toolbar.
1. **To export your new email experience(s)**, click **[!UICONTROL Export]** in the top toolbar.
   1. Select the format—CSV and images or HTML only—and click **[!UICONTROL Export]**.
