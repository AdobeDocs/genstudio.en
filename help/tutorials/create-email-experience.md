# Create an email experience

This tutorial demonstrates how to generated branded email experiences using GenStudio [[!DNL Create] mode](/help/user-guide/create/overview.md) (paintbrush icon in the left navigation area).

To create an effective email experience, it is recommended that you [add brand references to GenStudio](/help/user-guide/references/add-references.md) and brush up on the [basics of crafting a prompt](/help/user-guide/effective-prompts.md) before you begin.

## Choose a template

To get started creating a new email experience, use an available template to provide the framework for your content.

**To choose an email template**:

1. In _[!DNL Create]_ mode, click **[!UICONTROL Email]** in the _"What do you want to create today?"_ section.
1. Click to open a template in the _Recent templates_ section, or click **[!UICONTROL View all templates]** to see more available templates.
   1. In the _Select template_ pane, toggle the _Channels_ filter to **[!UICONTROL Email]**.
   1. Use the search option, adjacent to _Filter_, to find a specific email template.
   1. Click to select an email template, or toggle select multiple email templates, and click **[!UICONTROL Use]**. If you select multiple templates, when the variants are generated all selected templates will be used to provide you options.

   The Canvas, the epicenter of content creation, appears.

## Add parameters

Adding reference parameters supercharges the content generation process and is an integral preparatory step for creating a new email experience.

**To add parameters—brand references and images**:

1. Click the _Parameters_ icon to begin adding references parameters and image content.
1. In the _Parameters_ section, add brand references—Brand, Product, and Persona—to inform content creation.

   If there are no brands, personas, or products available from these menus, [add brand references to your GenStudio](/help/user-guide/references/add-references.md).

1. In the _Content_ section, add content to be used in the experience *and* to influence content generation.
   1. Click **[!UICONTROL Select content]** or drop files in the _Content_ section.
   1. **[!UICONTROL Browse your device]** or **[!UICONTROL Select from GenStudio content]** to choose images to use.

   When you select images from GenStudio content, you are choosing from images already saved to [[!DNL Content]](/help/user-guide/content/overview.md). You can filter by channel, product, language, and more, to find the needed images quickly.

When you are done adding parameters, you can collapse the *Parameters* and *Content* sections by clicking the _Parameters_ icon again.

## Use a prompt

After brand references are selected, craft a prompt using natural language to start generating content for your new email experience.

See [Write effective prompts](/help/user-guide/effective-prompts.md) to learn more about writing prompts.

**To use a prompt**:

1. Enter a prompt in the _"Describe the experiences you want to generate"_ prompt box.

   If the prompt box is not visible, click **[!UICONTROL Open to prompt]** to expand it.

1. Optionally, click one of the prompt suggestions visible just above the prompt text box. Clicking a suggestion auto-fills the suggested prompt in the prompt box.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Generate]**.

By default, four generated variations—all fueled by the prompt, reference parameters, and images you added—are shown in the Canvas.

## Revise generated emails

Before selecting what to send for approval or publish to [!DNL Content] you can edit email fragments or delete a variant from the set of generated emails.

**To revise generated variants**:

* **To manually edit an email**, double-click into any of the email fragments (such as the subject line, header, or body copy) and edit as needed.

   The subject line and preheader only require a single click to edit, while the header, body copy, and CTA require a double-click.

* **To delete an email**, click to select the email title (for example, "Email 1/4") and click **[!UICONTROL Delete variant]**.

## Verify brand alignment

To optimize the generated emails and ensure strict adherence to brand identity, leverage the power of the [Brand Validation pane](/help/user-guide/references/brand-validation.md#brand-validation-panel). The Brand Validation pane illuminates areas for improvement. You can manually edit individual email fragments or [generate refined variants](/help/user-guide/create/generate-variants.md) of the initial result to achieve alignment with your brand.

**To verify brand alignment using the Brand Validation panel**:

1. Open the brand validation panel and toggle through each email to see how the generated content is checked against your brand references and other GenStudio guidelines.
1. [Manually revise emails](#revise-generated-emails), or [generate variants](/help/user-guide/create/generate-variants.md), to ensure your emails are closely aligned with your brand.

See [Brand validation](/help/user-guide/references/brand-validation.md#use-brand-validation-to-improve-content) for more information.

## Get reviews and approvals

Use the Approvals pane, accessible on the top menu bar of the Canvas, to obtain reviews, track review comments, and get approvals from stakeholders.

To obtain reviews and approvals:

1. [Launch an approval request](/help/user-guide/approvals/request-review.md) to solicit an [approval of drafted email experiences](/help/user-guide/approvals/approve-content.md).
1. [Remove or add reviewers](/help/user-guide/approvals/review-and-edit.md#manage-approvals) during the review process.
1. [Access the content for review](/help/user-guide/approvals/review-and-edit.md#access-content-for-review) and view the requests for revision.
1. Edit the drafts per review comments and [publish email experiences](#publish-and-export-experience).

See [Reviews and approvals](/help/user-guide/approvals/overview.md) for more information.

## Publish and export experience

To make the generated emails available for current and future use, publish it to [!UICONTROL Content] and export it for use in your marketing campaigns.

1. **To publish your new email experience(s)**, click **[!UICONTROL Publish]** in the top toolbar.
1. **To export your new email experience(s)**, click **[!UICONTROL Export]** in the top toolbar.
   1. Select the format—CSV and images or HTML only—and click **[!UICONTROL Export]**.
