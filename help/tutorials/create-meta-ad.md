# Create a Meta ad experience

This tutorial demonstrates how to generate branded Meta ad experiences using GenStudio [[!DNL Create]](/help/user-guide/create/overview.md) (paintbrush icon in the left navigation area).

Before you begin generating a Meta ad experience, it is important to [incorporate guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/add-guidelines.md) in GenStudio and become familiar with the basics of [creating a prompt](/help/user-guide/effective-prompts.md).

## Choose a template

To get started generating a new Meta ad experience, use an available template to provide the framework for your content.

**To choose a Meta ad template**:

1. In _[!DNL Create]_, click **[!UICONTROL Meta ads]** in the _"What do you want to create today?"_ section.
1. In the _Select template_ view, toggle the _Channels_ filter to **[!UICONTROL Meta ads]**.
1. Use the search option, adjacent to _Filter_, to find a specific Meta ad template.
1. Click to select a template, or toggle select multiple templates, and click **[!UICONTROL Use]**. If you select multiple templates, when the variants are generated all selected templates will be used to provide you options.

   This action opens the Canvas, which is the central hub for content creation.

## Add parameters

Adding guidelines parameters enhances the content generation process and is a crucial step in preparing to generate a Meta ad.

**To add parameters and assets**:

1. Click the _Parameters_ icon to expand the parameters options and add references parameters and assets.
1. In the _Parameters_ section, select guidelines—[!DNL Brands], [!DNL Personas], and [!DNL Products]—to inform content creation.

   If there are no brands, personas, or products available from these menus, [add guidelines to your GenStudio](/help/user-guide/guidelines/add-guidelines.md).

1. In the _Content_ section, add content to be used in the experience *and* to influence content generation. There are three ways to add assets:
   * Click **[!UICONTROL Select from content]** to select assets (images or video) already published to [!DNL Content]. Use the filters to further narrow your search results.
   * Click **[!UICONTROL Upload]** to browse your files and choose assets to use. Along with browsing your device, you can also import from Microsoft OneDrive or Dropbox.
   * Drag and drop image files into the _Content_ section.

   When you select assets from GenStudio content, you are choosing from assets already saved to [[!DNL Content]](/help/user-guide/content/overview.md). You can filter by channel, product, language, and more, to find the needed assets quickly.

When you are done adding parameters, you can collapse the *Parameters* and *Content* sections by clicking the _Parameters_ icon again.

## Use a prompt

After guidelines are selected, craft a prompt using natural language to start generating content for your new Meta ad experience.

See [Write effective prompts](/help/user-guide/effective-prompts.md) to learn more about writing prompts.

**To use a prompt**:

1. Enter a prompt in the _"Describe the experiences you want to generate"_ prompt box.
   <!-- If the prompt box is not visible, click **[!UICONTROL Open to prompt]** to expand it. -->

<!-- 1. Optionally, click one of the prompt suggestions visible just above the prompt text box. Clicking a suggestion auto-fills the suggested prompt in the prompt box. -->
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Generate]**.

By default, four generated variations—all fueled by the prompt, guidelines, and content you added—are shown in the Canvas.

## Choose Meta ads channel

When generating a Meta ad, you can choose between Facebook or Instagram ads.

Toggle the Meta ads channel option in the top menu bar to **Facebook** or **Instagram** to manage each channel's generated drafts.

## Revise generated Meta ads

Before selecting what to send for approval or publishing to [!DNL Content] you can edit the Meta ads or delete a variant from the set of generated ads.

**To revise generated variants**:

* **To manually edit an Meta ad**, double-click into any of the ad fragments (such as the subject line, header, or body copy) and edit as needed.

   The subject line and preheader only require a single click to edit, while the header and body copy require a double-click.

* **To change or select the call to action**, click the call to action button and select from an available button.
* **To delete an Meta ad**, click to select the ad title (for example, "Meta 4") and click **[!UICONTROL Delete variant]**.

## Verify brand alignment

To optimize the generated ads and ensure strict adherence to brand identity, leverage the power of the [_Brand guidelines check_](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md#brand-guidelines-check)—providing a summary of brand alignment for a variant—and the [_Brand validation panel_](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md#brand-validation-panel)—displaying comprehensive brand validation details and illuminating improvement areas.

You can manually edit individual ad fragments or [generate refined variants](/help/user-guide/create/generate-variants.md) of the initial result to achieve alignment with your brand.

**To verify brand alignment**:

1. Click the [**[!UICONTROL [!DNL Brand] guidelines check]**](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md#brand-guidelines-check) icon for a variant and see a summary of how that variant performs when checked against your brand.
1. To get the details of the fragments and guidelines that need improvement, click **[!UICONTROL Review]** _or_ click the Brand validation icon in top menu bar to open the [_Brand validation panel_](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md#brand-validation-panel).

1. Toggle through each ad to see how you can improve the generated content to be more brand-aligned.
1. [Manually revise emails](#revise-generated-emails), or [generate variants](/help/user-guide/create/generate-variants.md), to ensure your ads are closely aligned with your brand.

See [Brand validation](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md).

## Get reviews and approvals

Use the Approvals panel, accessible on the top menu bar of the Canvas, to obtain reviews, track review comments, and get approvals from stakeholders.

**To obtain reviews and approvals**:

1. [Launch an approval request](/help/user-guide/approvals/request-review.md) to solicit an [approval of drafted Meta ad experiences](/help/user-guide/approvals/approve-content.md).
1. [Remove or add reviewers](/help/user-guide/approvals/review-and-edit.md#manage-approvals) during the review process.
1. [Access the content for review](/help/user-guide/approvals/review-and-edit.md#access-content-for-review) and view the requests for revision.
1. Edit the drafts per review comments and [publish your Meta ad experiences](#publish-and-export-experience).

See [Reviews and approvals](/help/user-guide/approvals/overview.md) for more information.

## Publish and export experience

To make the generated Meta ads available for current and future use, publish it to [!UICONTROL Content] and export it for use in your marketing campaigns.

1. **To publish your new Meta ad experience(s)**, click **[!UICONTROL Publish]** in the top toolbar.
1. **To export your new Meta ad experience(s)**, click **[!UICONTROL Export]** in the top toolbar.
   1. Select the format—CSV and images or HTML only—and click **[!UICONTROL Export]**.
