# Create a Meta ad experience

This tutorial demonstrates how to generate branded Meta ad experiences using GenStudio [[!DNL Create]](/help/user-guide/create/overview.md) (paintbrush icon in the left navigation area).

Before you begin generating a Meta ad experience, it is important to [incorporate guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/add-guidelines.md) in GenStudio and become familiar with the basics of [creating a prompt](/help/user-guide/effective-prompts.md).

## Choose a template

To get started generating a new Meta ad experience, use an available template to provide the framework for your content.

**To choose a Meta ad template**:

1. In _[!DNL Create]_, click **[!UICONTROL Meta ads]** in the _"What do you want to create today?"_ section.
1. Use the search option, adjacent to _Filter_, to find a specific Meta ad template.
1. Click to select a template and click **[!UICONTROL Use]**.

   This action opens the Canvas, which is the central hub for content creation.

## Add parameters

Adding [guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/overview.md) and assets in _Parameters_ in the prompt area enhances the content generation process and is a crucial step in preparing to generate a Meta ad.

**To add parameters and assets**:

1. Click the _Parameters_ icon to expand the prompt area.
1. In the _Parameters_ section, select guidelines—[!DNL Brands], [!DNL Personas], and [!DNL Products]—to inform content creation.

   If there are no brands, personas, or products available from these menus, [add guidelines to your GenStudio](/help/user-guide/guidelines/add-guidelines.md).

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Select content]** to add content to be used in the experience *and* to influence content generation.
   * Click **[!UICONTROL Select from content]** to select assets (images) already published to [!DNL Content]. Use the filters to further narrow your search results.
   * Click **[!UICONTROL Upload]** to browse your files and choose assets to use. Along with browsing your device, you can also import from Microsoft OneDrive or Dropbox.
   * Drag and drop assets into the _Content_ section.

When you are done adding parameters, you can collapse the prompt area by clicking the _Parameters_ icon again.

## Enter a prompt

After guidelines are selected, craft a prompt using natural language to start generating content for your new Meta ad experience. Detailed prompts yield higher quality output than vague or indescriptive prompts.

See [Write effective prompts](/help/user-guide/effective-prompts.md) to learn more about writing prompts.

**To enter a prompt**:

1. Enter a prompt in the _"Describe the experiences you want to generate"_ prompt box.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Generate]**.

By default, four variations—all fueled by the prompt, guidelines, and content you added—are generated and shown in the Canvas.

## Choose Meta ads channel

When generating a Meta ad, you can choose between Facebook or Instagram ads.

Toggle the Meta ads channel option in the top menu bar to **Facebook** or **Instagram** to manage each channel's generated drafts.

## Revise generated Meta ads

Before selecting what to send for approval or publishing to [!DNL Content] you can edit the Meta ads or delete a variant from the set of generated ads.

**To revise generated variants**:

* **To edit the Meta ad draft name**, click into the _Untitled Draft_ title at the top of the Canvas and enter a new title.
* **To manually edit an Meta ad**, double-click into any of the ad fragments (such as the subject line, header, or body copy) and edit as needed.

   The subject line and preheader only require a single click to edit, while the header and body copy require a double-click.

* **To change or select the call to action**, click the call to action button and select from an available button.
* **To delete an Meta ad**, click to select the ad title (for example, "Meta 4") and click **[!UICONTROL Delete variant]**.

## Verify brand alignment

To optimize the generated ads and ensure strict adherence to brand identity, leverage the power of the [_Brand guidelines check_](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md#brand-guidelines-check)—providing a summary of brand alignment for a variant—and the [_Brand validation panel_](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md#brand-validation-panel)—displaying comprehensive brand validation details and illuminating improvement areas.

**To verify brand alignment**:

1. Click the [**[!UICONTROL [!DNL Brand] guidelines check]**](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md#brand-guidelines-check) icon for a variant and see a summary of how that variant performs when checked against your brand.
1. To get the details of the fragments and guidelines that need improvement, click **[!UICONTROL Review]** _or_ click the Brand validation icon in top menu bar to open the [_Brand validation panel_](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md#brand-validation-panel).

1. Toggle through each ad to see how you can improve the generated content to be more brand-aligned.
1. [Manually revise ads](#revise-generated-meta-ads) to ensure your ads are closely aligned with your brand.

See [Brand validation](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md).

## Get reviews and approvals

Use the Approvals panel, accessible on the top menu bar of the Canvas, to obtain reviews, track review comments, and get approvals from stakeholders.

**To obtain reviews and approvals**:

1. [Launch an approval request](/help/user-guide/approvals/request-review.md) to solicit an [approval of drafted Meta ad experiences](/help/user-guide/approvals/approve-content.md).
1. [Remove or add reviewers](/help/user-guide/approvals/review-and-edit.md#manage-approvals) during the review process.
1. [Access the content for review](/help/user-guide/approvals/review-and-edit.md#access-content-for-review) and view the requests for revision.
1. Edit the drafts per review comments and [publish your Meta ad experiences](#publish-and-export-experience).

See [Reviews and approvals](/help/user-guide/approvals/overview.md) for more information.

## Publish and export experience

To make the generated Meta ads available for current and future use, publish it to [!UICONTROL Content] and export it for use in your marketing campaigns.

1. **To publish your new Meta ad experience(s)**, click **[!UICONTROL Publish]** in the top toolbar.
1. **To export your new Meta ad experience(s)**, click **[!UICONTROL Export]** in the top toolbar.
   1. Select the format—CSV and images or HTML only—and click **[!UICONTROL Export]**.
