# Add brand references to GenStudio

Brand references are a collection of user-defined brand guidelines—for brands, products, and personas—in GenStudio. Brand references ensure any AI-generated content is customized to align with the specific brand identity, enabling effective personalization of content.

See the [GenStudio brand references overview](/help/user-guide/references/overview.md).

Adding brand references to GenStudio is an important step in the creation process. Brands, Products, and Personas inform the content creation process, along with user-inputted prompts and Adobe generative AI technology, to craft impactful assets.

## Add brands

To add a brand to GenStudio, you can [**upload a brand guide**](#upload-brand-guidelines) or [**manually create a brand**](#manually-add-brand) by selecting guidelines and entering your brand details.

In the left navigation area, click **Brands**. In the _Brands_ panel, select **Add brand**.

### Upload brand guidelines

You can upload your own brand guidelines documents to populate a new brand in GenStudio.

See [Brands](/help/user-guide/references/brands.md) to view a sample brand guide.

**To upload brand guidelines**:

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Add brand]** button and choose **Use brand guidelines**.
1. In the _Add new brand_ popup, enter a brand name and attach or drag in your brand guide.

   You can attach up to three PDF or DOC files.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Add brand]**.

GenStudio extracts information from your uploaded documents and begins building your brand. You see brand information, such as brand voice, channel, and image guidelines, populate as GenStudio assembles each guideline from your brand documents.

A popup reminds you to review the extracted content before you [publish the brand](#publish-brand).

### Manually add brand

You can manually add brand details, instead of uploading existing brand documents, to populate a new [brand](/help/user-guide/references/brands.md) in GenStudio.

**To manually add a brand**:

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Add brand]** button and choose **[!UICONTROL Manually add brand]**.

   You can populate various optional guidelines and imagery to build out your brand.

1. Add information about your brand in the _About_ section.
1. Enter _Brand voice guidelines_.
1. Enter _Channel guidelines_, for each applicable channel (Email, Facebook, Instagram, Display ads).
1. Enter _Image guidelines_.

   Optionally, add a guidelines category for Imagery to add your own guidelines.

1. Add brand logos in the _Logos_ section.
1. Click into the _New brand_ title and enter a descriptive brand name.

To see your created brands, click the back arrow near the top of the _Brand_ pane to navigate back to the _Brands_ home.

You do not have to [publish](#publish-brand) your brand to make the information accessible. Any manually added information is available immediately after it is added. For others in your organization to use the brand info in GenStudio, you must publish it.

### Publish brand

Before publishing your brand, click through the _Brand voice guidelines_, _Channel guidelines_, _Image guidelines_, and _Logos_ sections to review all the populated information. Make changes to the brand guidelines as needed.

**To publish the brand**:

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Publish]**.

   In the _Publish brand_ popup, verify who has access (to view and use) to the published brand.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Publish]**.

When the brand is published, a banner appears confirming that your brand is ready to use: "*Brand published and available to use*".

The published brand is now available for use.
