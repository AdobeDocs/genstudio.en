# Add References to GenStudio

References are a collection of user-defined brand guidelines added to GenStudio that ensure any AI-generated content is customized to align with the specific brand identity, enabling effective personalization of content.

See the [Genstudio References Overview](/help/user-guide/references/overview.md) for more information.

Adding References to GenStudio is an important step in the creation process. Brands, Products, and Personas inform the content creation process, along with user inputted prompts and Adobe generative AI technology, to craft impactful assets.

## Add Brands

To add a brand to GenStudio, you can [**upload a brand guide**](#upload-brand-guidelines) or [**manually create a brand**](#manually-add-brand) by inputting the needed details.

In the *References* section, click **Brands**. In the _Brands_ panel select **Add brand**.

### Upload Brand guidelines

You can upload your own brand guidelines documents to populate a new Brand in GenStudio.

See [Brands](/help/user-guide/references/brands.md) to view a sample brand guide.

1. Select the **Add brand** button and choose **Use brand guidelines**.
1. In the _Add new brand_ popup, enter a brand name and attach or drag in your brand guide(s).

   You can attach up to three .pdf or .doc files.

1. Select **Add brand**.

GenStudio extracts information from your uploaded documents and begins building your brand. You see brand information, such as brand voice, channel, and image guidelines, populated as GenStudio assembles each guideline from your brand documents.

A popup appears reminding you to review the extracted content before you [publish the brand](#publish-brand).

### Manually add brand

## Publish brand

To publish the brand:

   In the _Publish brand_ popup that appears, see who has access (to view and use) to the published brand.

When the brand is published, a banner will appear confirming that your brand is ready to use: "*Brand published and available to use*".

The published brand is now available for use in GenStudio Brands.
