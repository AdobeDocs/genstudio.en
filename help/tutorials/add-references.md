# Add brand references to GenStudio

References are a collection of user-defined brand guidelines—brands, products, and personas—added to GenStudio that ensure any AI-generated content is customized to align with the specific brand identity, enabling effective personalization of content.

See the [GenStudio brand references Overview](/help/user-guide/references/overview.md) for more information.

Adding brand references to GenStudio is an important step in the creation process. Brands, Products, and Personas inform the content creation process, along with user inputted prompts and Adobe generative AI technology, to craft impactful assets.

## Add brands

To add a brand to GenStudio, you can [**upload a brand guide**](#upload-brand-guidelines) or [**manually create a brand**](#manually-add-brand) by inputting the needed details.

In the left navigation area click **Brands**. In the _Brands_ panel select **Add brand**.
