     </tr>

### Size {#size-of-an-asset} 

Size demonstrates the logical value of an asset as per its dimensions. It clarifies the space an asset is taking in DAM. Content Hub support assets up to 2GB. 

### Tags {#tags}

Tags help you categorize assets that can be browsed and searched more efficiently. Tagging helps in propagating the appropriate taxonomy to other users and workflows. 

### Smart Tags{#smart-tags} 

Content Hub uses Adobe Sensei's smart content services to train assets using recognition algorithm on the tags-based structure. This content intelligence is then used to apply relevant tags on a different set of assets. Smart Tags increase the content velocity of your projects by helping you find relevant assets quickly. The smart tags are an example of metadata that is not contained in the image. Content Hub automatically applies smart tags to assets, by default. 

### Date range {#date-range} 

The date range allows you to select dates you want to see the assets. You can customize date range by choosing the start and end dates.
