![Share assets banner image](assets/search-assets-banner.png)

When you have a large number of assets in your repository, searching for the right asset is time-consuming. [!DNL Content Hub] search provides you with the capability to look for the approved assets so that you can perform additional actions on them, such as download, share, or create collections. You can utilize various capabilities such as performing text-based search, using filters to narrow down your search results, performing tags or smart tags specific search, searching for the particular file format.

## What you can search for  {#what-you-can-search}

The [!DNL Content Hub] search provides results based on: 

* **Matching text:** The [!DNL Content Hub] search allows you to search for an asset using its name or description. You can perform keyword-based search, which compares the keyword to the text available in the properties of an asset. 

* **Matching context:** [!DNL Content Hub] search results list contains proximate results of assets that you get based on the matching text. For example, if you type `cool` in the search bar, the assets related to `winter`, `snow`, `cold surroundings`, etc. appear in the search list. 

* **Asset information (title, tags, or smart tags):** [!DNL Content Hub] uses smart search algorithm to rank search results accurately and as relevant as possible. Metadata is the collection of all the data available for an asset, but it may not necessarily be contained in that asset. It helps you further categorize assets and is helpful as the amount of digital information grows. 

* **Last modified date:** The assets that were modified recently appear on the top of search results list. You can also filter the date range as per your requirement. 

* **Usage:** The commonly used assets appear on the top of the search list.

## Narrow your search results using filters {#narrow-down-search-results}

Use the Filters panel to search for assets based on metadata. You can filter search results based on various search predicates, such as [!UICONTROL tags], [!UICONTROL subject], [!UICONTROL format], and [!UICONTROL last modified date]. The filters have mixed-state checkboxes. You can select all the required predicates to minimize your search results.
