# Upload brand approved assets to Adobe GenStudio {#upload-brand-approved-assets-genstudio}

Add assets to the Content module of Adobe GenStudio either from your local file system or while creating assets using Adobe Express and saving it to Adobe GenStudio using the Express-add on. All assets display at the top-level in Adobe GenStudio irrespective of the folder structure available on your local file system to enhance the search capabilities.

To further enhance asset search, Content module of Adobe GenStudio allows you to:

* Define key details relevant to your asset upload, such as Project or campaign name, keywords, channels, and so on. 

* Automatically generate more properties for each asset upon successful upload, such as, file size, format, resolution, and some other properties.

* Use artificial intelligence provided by [Adobe Sensei](https://www.adobe.com/sensei.html) to automatically apply relevant tags to all your uploaded assets. These tags, aptly named Smart Tags, increase the content velocity of your projects by helping you find relevant assets quickly.

Ensure that you only upload your brand approved assets to the Content module of Adobe GenStudio.
