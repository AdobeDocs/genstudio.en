# Brand validation

In GenStudio for Performance Marketers, brand validation is an essential component that works in collaboration with the generative AI functionality and guidelines—[[!DNL Brands]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brands.md), [[!DNL Products]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/products.md), and [[!DNL Personas]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/personas.md). It ensures that all your content aligns with your brand identity.

GenStudio for Performance Marketers conducts brand validation on various aspects, including:

* Brand guidelines specific to each customer
* Copy guidelines for different channel platforms
* Ethical considerations related to gender, ethnicity, race, disability status, and age in AI-generated content

## Brand guidelines check

A summary of brand validation information for each generated content variant is accessible through the _Brand guidelines check_ icon next to each variant in the Canvas.

The _Brand guidelines check_ displays the percentage of compliance with your [brand](brands.md). The percentage is calculated as the number of [guidelines](overview.md) that passed validation versus the number of guidelines tested.

Click the icon to see which guidelines are compliant with your brand and which need review.

See [Improve brand alignment](#improve-brand-alignment).

## Brand validation panel

The _Brand validation panel_  provides detailed brand validation information and illuminates opportunities for improvement for each variant section.

The _Brand validation panel_ displays information for:

* **Email**: 
  * Subject line section
  * Preheader section
  * Header section
  * Body section
  * CTA (call to action) section
  * Brand voice guidelines
* **Meta ad**:
  * Headline section
  * Body copy section
  * CTA (call to action) section
  * On-image text section

See [Improve brand alignment](#improve-brand-alignment).

### Filter

In the _Brand validation panel_ you can filter what guidelines are shown. Click the filter icon at the top of the panel to view:

* **Failed guidelines**—_Show failed guidelines_ displays only the guidelines that did not pass brand validation.
* **All guidelines**—_Show failed and passed guidelines_ displays all guidelines for which the variants are measured against.
* **Passed guidelines**—_Show passed guidelines_ displays only the guidelines that passed brand validation.

<!-- The _Brand validation panel_ has different areas of focus for each content channel:

* Email - brand voice and channel compliance
* Images - application photography restrictions and other considerations -->

## Improve brand alignment

To maximize effectiveness of generated content and maintain consistent brand identity, use the _Brand guidelines check_ and the _Brand Validation panel_. You can manually modify specific sections to align with your [brand guidelines](brands.md).

**To improve brand alignment for generated content variants**:

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL [!DNL Brand] guidelines check]** icon for an individual variant.

   See a summary of how that specific variant performs—guidelines that pass brand validation and those that need review—when checked against your brand.

1. To get the details of the sections and guidelines that need improvement, click **[!UICONTROL Review]** _or_ click the Brand validation icon in top menu bar to open the _Brand validation panel_.

   See all sections and brand guidelines that need your attention. The section highlighted in the panel corresponds to the section highlighted in the generated variant in the Canvas.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   > The _Brand voice_ guideline noted in the _Brand validation panel_ applies to the entire variant, not an individual section. The whole content variant is highlighted for suggested improvement.

1. Manually revise variant sections to achieve the strongest alignment to your brand.

1. After making necessary revisions, click **[!UICONTROL Re-check]** to validate your changes and ensure they are more closely aligned with your brand identity.

   The brand validation process will run again. If the section/guideline passes validation, a green checkmark appears for that section in the _Brand validation panel_. The percentage in the _Brand guideline check_ icon for the revised variant also shows your progress.

1. Continue revising sections to ensure the entire variant passes brand validation.

   Navigate between guidelines in the _Brand validation panel_ using the **[!UICONTROL Next]** and **[!UICONTROL Previous]** buttons.

1. At the top of the _Brand validation panel_, navigate through each variant using the arrows (for instance, use the arrow to move from `Email 1` to `Email 2`) and continue revising sections to better adhere to your brand.

   See [Brand voice guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brands.md#brand-voice-guidelines) for more information on considered guidelines.
