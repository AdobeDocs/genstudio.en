# Brand validation

In GenStudio, brand validation is an essential component that works in collaboration with the generative AI functionality, and guidelinesâ€”[[!DNL Brands]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brands.md), [[!DNL Products]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/products.md), and [[!DNL Personas]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/personas.md). It ensures that all your content aligns with your brand identity.

GenStudio conducts brand validation on various aspects, including:

* Brand guidelines specific to each customer
* Copy guidelines for different channel platforms
* Ethical considerations related to gender, ethnicity, race, disability status, and age in AI-generated content
* Quality checks for plagiarism, grammar rules, correctness of human features in imagery, and factuality of GenAI hallucinations

When you are in [Create](/help/user-guide/create/overview.md) mode, brand validation information is available for any generated content. There is a Brand Validation icon for each piece of generated content that reveals its compliance with brand guidelines. By clicking the icon, you can access the Brand Validation panel, which provides analysis and feedback on key brand areas.

The Brand Validation panel has different areas of focus for each content channel:

* Email - brand voice and channel compliance
* Images - application photography restrictions and other considerations

## Brand Validation panel

The Brand Validation panel helps you identify areas where guidelines can be improved to adhere to your defined brand guidelines.

Brand validation logos show adjacent to the generated content preview in orange if improvements can be made, and in green if the content is assessed to be brand-aligned.

Within the Brand Validation panel, orange icons communicate the specific guideline to focus on for improvements, and a green checkmark icon indicates that the generated content successfully aligns with that specific guideline.

## Use Brand Validation to improve content

The Brand Validation panel makes it easy to ensure your generated content is informed by your comprehensive brand identity.

### For emails

**To verify brand alignment of emails:**

1. Click the Brand Validation logo for an individual email _or_ click the Brand Validation logo in the top menu bar.
1. In the _Brand Validation_ panel, toggle through each email to see how the generated content compares against the **[!UICONTROL Brand voice]** and **[!UICONTROL Channel guidelines]**.

   See [Brand voice guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brands.md) for more information on considered guidelines.
