# Brand validation

In GenStudio, brand validation is an essential component that works in collaboration with the generative AI functionality and guidelines—[[!DNL Brands]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brands.md), [[!DNL Products]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/products.md), and [[!DNL Personas]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/personas.md). It ensures that all your content aligns with your brand identity.

GenStudio conducts brand validation on various aspects, including:

* Brand guidelines specific to each customer
* Copy guidelines for different channel platforms
* Ethical considerations related to gender, ethnicity, race, disability status, and age in AI-generated content
* Quality checks for plagiarism, grammar rules, correctness of human features in imagery, and factuality of GenAI hallucinations

## Brand guidelines check

A summary of brand validation information for each generated content variant is available via the _Brand guidelines check_ icon next to each variant in the Canvas.

The _Brand guidelines check_ displays the percentage of compliance with your brand [guidelines](overview.md). Click the icon to see which guidelines are compliant with your brand and which need review.

See [Improve brand compliance](#improve-brand-compliance).

## Brand Validation panel

The _Brand Validation panel_  provides detailed brand validation information and illuminates opportunities for improvement for all content fragments and brand guidelines.

The _Brand Validation panel_ displays information for:

* Email: 
  * Subject line fragment
  * Preheader fragment
  * Header fragment
  * Body fragment
  * CTA (call to action) fragment
  * Brand voice guidelines
* Meta ad:
  * xx

See [Improve brand alignment](#improve-brand-alignment).

<!-- The _Brand Validation panel_ has different areas of focus for each content channel:

* Email - brand voice and channel compliance
* Images - application photography restrictions and other considerations -->

## Improve brand alignment

To maximize effectiveness of generated content and maintain consistent brand identity, use the _Brand guidelines check_ and the _Brand Validation panel_. You can manually modify specific fragments or [generate refined variants](/help/user-guide/create/generate-variants.md) to align with your [[!DNL Brand] guidelines](brands.md).

**To improve brand alignment for generated content variants:**

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL [!DNL Brand] guidelines check]** icon for an individual variant.

   See a summary of how that specific variant performs—brand compliant guidelines and guidelines that need review—when checked against your brand.

1. To open the _Brand validation panel_ and assess content that need improvement, click **[!UICONTROL Review]** _or_ click the Brand validation icon in top menu bar.

   See all fragments and brand guidelines that need your attention.
   
   The fragment highlighted in the panel corresponds to the fragment highlighted in the generated variant in the Canvas.

1. Using the suggestions, manually revise fragments of emails to achieve the strongest alignment to your brand.

   Optionally, you can [generate variants](/help/user-guide/create/generate-variants.md) to iterate on the initial result.

1. To validate your revisions, click **[!UICONTROL Re-check]**.

   If the guideline now passes validation a green checkmark appears for that fragment in the _Brand validation panel_. The percentage in the _Brand guideline check_ icon for the revised variant also shows your progress. You are automatically moved to the next fragment that needs your attention.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   > The _Brand voice_ guideline applies to the entire variant, not an individual fragment. The whole content variant will be highlighted for suggested improvement.

1. Continue revising fragments to ensure the entire variant passes brand validation.

   Navigate between guidelines in the _Brand validation panel_ using the **[!UICONTROL Next]** and **[!UICONTROL Previous]** buttons.

1. At the top of the _Brand validation panel_ navigate through each variant using the arrows and continue revising fragments to better adhere to your brand guidelines.

   See [Brand voice guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brands.md) for more information on considered guidelines.
