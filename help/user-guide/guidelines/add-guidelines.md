# Add guidelines

[[!DNL Brands]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brands.md), [[!DNL Products]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/products.md), and [[!DNL Personas]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/personas.md) are user-defined guidelines in GenStudio for Performance Marketers that ensure any AI-generated content is customized to align with brand identity, enabling effective personalization of content.

See the [guidelines overview](/help/user-guide/guidelines/overview.md).

Adding guidelines to GenStudio for Performance Marketers is an important step in the creation process. Guidelines inform the content creation process, along with user-defined prompts and Adobe generative AI technology, to craft impactful assets.

## Add [!DNL Brands]

To add a brand to GenStudio for Performance Marketers, you can [upload a brand guide](#upload-brand-guidelines) or [manually create a brand](#manually-add-brand) by selecting guidelines and entering your brand details. [Publish a brand](#publish-brand) to [!DNL Content] to make it available for use in future content generation.

In the left navigation area, click **[!DNL Brands]**. In the _[!DNL Brands]_ panel, select **Add brand**.

>[!TIP]
>Each brand operates independently with no hierarchical relationships. To create sub-brands under a parent brand, include the parent brand's information during the creation process.

### Add brand via upload

You can upload your own brand documents to populate a new brand in GenStudio for Performance Marketers.

See [[!DNL Brands]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brands.md).

**To upload brand documents**:

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Add brand]** button and choose **Use brand guidelines**.
1. In the _Add new brand_ popup, enter a brand name and attach or drag in your brand guide.

   You can attach up to three PDF or DOC files.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Add brand]**.

Using Adobe's generative AI technology, GenStudio for Performance Marketers extracts information from your uploaded documents and begins building your brand. You see brand information, such as brand voice, channel, and image guidelines populate as GenStudio for Performance Marketers assembles each guideline from your brand documents.

A popup reminds you to review the extracted content before you [publish the brand](#publish-brand).

### Manually add brand

You can manually add brand details, instead of uploading existing brand documents, to populate a new [brand](brands.md) in GenStudio for Performance Marketers.
