# Add guidelines

[[!DNL Brands]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brands.md), [[!DNL Products]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/products.md), and [[!DNL Personas]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/personas.md) are user-defined guidelines in GenStudio for Performance Marketing that ensure any AI-generated content is customized to align with brand identity, enabling effective personalization of content.

See the [guidelines overview](/help/user-guide/guidelines/overview.md).

Adding guidelines to GenStudio for Performance Marketing is an important step in the creation process. Guidelines inform the content creation process, along with user-defined prompts and Adobe generative AI technology, to craft impactful assets.

## Add [!DNL Brands]

To add a brand, [upload a brand guide](#upload-brand-guidelines) or [manually create a brand](#manually-add-brand) by selecting guidelines and entering your brand details. [Publish a brand](#publish-brand) to [!DNL Content] to make it available for use in future content generation.

In the left navigation area, click **[!DNL Brands]**. In the _[!DNL Brands]_ panel, select **Add brand**.

>[!TIP]
>Each brand operates independently with no hierarchical relationships. To create sub-brands under a parent brand, include the parent brand's information during the creation process.
