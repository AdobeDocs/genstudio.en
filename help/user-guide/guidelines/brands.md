# GenStudio [!DNL Brands]

A brand distinguishes an organization, product, service or concept from others. Some aspects of a brand are objective, like a logo, while others are subjective, like tone of voice.

GenStudio uses the wealth of brand information from your brand, partners it with [!DNL Product] and [!DNL Persona] information, and builds out a comprehensive brand identity. This brand identity is used to inform the creation of on-brand content using Adobe's generative AI technology.
