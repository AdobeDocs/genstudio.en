# Asset details

GenStudio stores approved content with rich metadata for discoverability and performance tracking.

Each asset (including experiences and templates) has associated metadata. The default metadata stored with an asset includes a campaign name, channel type, and basic file details, such as filename, timestamps, size, and more.

**To see content metadata**:

1. In _[!DNL Content]_ mode, select an asset.

1. In the asset view, review the _[!UICONTROL Details]_ section on the right.

   If the _[!UICONTROL Details]_ section is not visible, click the Information (i) icon.

>[!TIP]
>
>You can view asset details from [!DNL Insights], too. In _[!DNL Insights]_ mode, click **[!UICONTROL Assets]**. Search for the asset and TBD.

## Details from generated content

The information used to generate a new asset or experience becomes metadata, such as the prompt that was used. You can not edit the prompt once the content is approved, but you can use it as a starting place for generating something new.

## Generated tags

When assets are approved and stored in Content, GenStudio generates tags based on the asset features, such as color and tone, or keywords that identify asset features. You cannot edit tags.
