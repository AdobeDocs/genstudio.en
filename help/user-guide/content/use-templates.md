# Work with Templates

GenStudio templates are essential for enabling content creators to quickly produce consistent on-brand marketing content. Using templates significantly reduces the time and effort required to generate new content by providing a starting point that includes pre-configured layouts and design elements.

This guide provides detailed information on how to:

* Prepare an [email template](email-template.md) or Meta ad template
* [Customize templates for GenStudio](customize-template.md)
* [Upload templates](#upload-a-template) into GenStudio
* [Use templates to create experiences](#use-a-template)

## Anatomy of an email template

A basic email design includes the following elements: 

* **Preheader**: The preheader (between 40-50 characters) acts as a secondary subject line, complementing and enhancing the main subject line. The preheader is visible in a recipient's inbox alongside the subject line, before the email is even opened.  
* **Header**: The header is the top section of the email that the recipient sees after opening the email. It sets the tone and provides immediate context for the email content. 
* **Body**: The body is the main content area of the email where the primary message is conveyed. This can include text, images, and other media. 
* **CTA (Call to Action)**: The CTA is a call-to-action that encourages the recipient to take a specific action, such as clicking a link, making a purchase, or signing up for an event. 
* **Images**: Images are used to enhance the visual appeal of the email, break up text, and support the message. 
* **Footer**: The footer typically contains additional information such as contact details, social media links, legal disclaimers, and unsubscribe options.
