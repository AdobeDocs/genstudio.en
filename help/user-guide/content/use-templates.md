# Work with Templates

Templates are used to generate consistent content for emails and social media ads. They significantly reduce the time and effort required to create new content by providing a starting point that includes pre-configured layouts and design elements.

## Upload a template

GenStudio accepts templates in an HTML format. See how to [build custom templates](customize-template.md) for GenStudio.

1. In _[!DNL Content]_ mode, select the **[!UICONTROL Templates]** section.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add template]**.

1. In the _[!UICONTROL Add your approved template]_ pane, browse for the HTML template file or drag the HTML template file to the drop space. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

1. In the _[!UICONTROL Review structure detail]_ pane, verify that you are using the correct template and that all the details are as expected. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

1. In the _[!UICONTROL Add your template details]_ pane, name your template and select a **[!UICONTROL Channel]** type.
