# Work with Templates

Templates are used to generate consistent content for email messages, social media, and display ads. They significantly reduce the time and effort required to create new content by providing a starting point that includes pre-configured layouts and design elements.

## Use a template

There are several out-of-the-box templates that you can use to experiment with and create experiences.
