## [!DNL Content] capabilities

GenStudio for Performance Marketers [!DNL Content] makes it easy to manage your approved assets and accelerate the content lifecycle. In **[!UICONTROL [!DNL Content]]**, you can search, find, and reuse performant content or select an asset or experience to jumpstart the creation of new variants for an evergreen campaign.

### Upload assets

The **[!UICONTROL Add assets]** panel allows you to drag-and-drop or browse for assets in your local files. Optionally, you can import assets from an external source, such as OneDrive or Dropbox. A [!UICONTROL Campaign] or Project name is the only required detail before upload. Providing more details such as Keywords, enables everyone on your team to identify and retrieve relevant content quickly.

### Search and find approved content

When you save approved assets, [!DNL Content] maintains the rich metadata, generation context, and audit history. Asset details help to narrow search results quickly using filter and search strings. GenStudio for Performance Marketers' AI automatically identifies and stores certain details, such as color. Searching for `blue` in the search field narrows the content list to assets tagged as blue.

### Work with templates

Templates speed up the creation process so that you can generate consistent content across multiple channels. Upload your custom template for use as a starting point in the creation process with pre-configured layouts and design elements.
