# Connect an AEM content repository


These are steps Sally takes to set up the connection between GenStudio and existing AEM CS repos to read approved content from Content Hub configurations.

TBD

<!-->
Deploy Content Hub for existing AEM repo (self-service in Cloud Manager) 
After enabling Content Hub for Assets using Cloud Manager, there is a new instance created within AEM Assets as a Cloud Service on Admin Console with contenthub as the suffix
Onboard GenStudio users:  
Add GenStudio users or user groups to the Content Hub product profiles (self-service in Admin Console)
Content Hub users can view assets but cannot add any new assets or modify existing assets
Approve existing assets to show up in Content Hub and GenStudio 
Configure what GenStudio users would see in existing AEM CS repo (self-service in Content Hub configuration UI)
Configure filters, metadata in Assets View Details page, search, and brand name that is available for GenStudio users
For a later phase, setup workflow/metadata profiles for auto approval
