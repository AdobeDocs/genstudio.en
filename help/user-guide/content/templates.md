# Templates

Templates are used to generate consistent content for email messages, social media, and display ads. They significantly reduce the time and effort required to create new content by providing a starting point that includes pre-configured layouts and design elements.

## Use a template

 There are several out-of-the-box templates that you can use to experiment with creating experiences.

- Sections (up to 3) can include only one of each:
   - `headline`
