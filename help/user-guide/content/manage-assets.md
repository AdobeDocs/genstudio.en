# Manage assets and experiences

**To add one or more assets**:

1. In _[!DNL Content]_, click **[!UICONTROL Add assets]**.

1. In the _Add your approved assets_ view, drop a file or files in the drop space. Optionally, you can select from local files using **[!UICONTROL Browse]** or import files from Dropbox or Microsoft OneDrive.

1. In the _Add details_ section, select a **[!UICONTROL Campaign name]** or enter a new name.

1. Add more details to improve discoverability.

   The more details that you provide, the more you experience the robust capabilities of GenStudio. Select one or more details from the list, or enter a new one where applicable, such as with keywords. Each detail you add appears below the list. Click `x` to remove a detail.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add assets]**.

## Search assets

The [!DNL Content] search interface is quick and responsive, and provides a productive search-first experience.

Apply filters and use metadata tags from asset details to narrow search results. For example, you may want to find an asset to help you build a new experience for your campaign.

**To search for content to reuse**:

1. In _[!DNL Content]_, select the **[!UICONTROL Assets]** section.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Search]** (magnifying glass) to enter a keyword or description.

1. Narrow your search by selecting a category from the _[!UICONTROL Filter]_ list. For example, if you are looking for a PNG file, click **[!UICONTROL File format]** and choose **PNG**.

   The more you narrow your search, the fewer filter options available. Click **[!UICONTROL Clear all]** to remove all filters.

1. Select an asset for a full view and a list of details.

   Click **[!UICONTROL Download]** (down arrow) to use the asset in your local workstation.
