# Manage assets and experiences

Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketers [!DNL Content] simplifies and enhances the management of brand-approved assets for use and reuse in your digital marketing journey.

## Add assets

**To add one or more assets**:

1. In _[!DNL Content]_, click **[!UICONTROL Add assets]**.

1. In the _Add your approved assets_ view, drop a file or files in the drop space. Optionally, you can select from local files using **[!UICONTROL Browse]** or import files from Dropbox or Microsoft OneDrive.

1. In the _Add details_ section, select a **[!UICONTROL Campaign name]** or enter a new name.

1. To improve discoverability, add optional details such as _Brand name_, _Personas_, _Region_ and _Keywords_ in the **More details** section.

   The more details that you provide, the more you experience the robust capabilities of GenStudio for Performance Marketers. Select one or more details from the list, or enter a new one where applicable, such as with keywords. Each detail you add appears below the list. Click **`x`** to remove a detail.

   Any details you add apply to all the assets added in this action.

   See [Metadata details](/help/user-guide/content/asset-details.md#system-metadata).

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add assets]**.
1. When the asset upload is completed, click **Done**.
1. To view your new uploaded assets, click **[!UICONTROL Refresh]** from the _New assets available_ notification at the bottom of the Canvas.

## Search assets

The [!DNL Content] search interface is quick and responsive, and provides a productive search-first experience.

Apply filters and use metadata tags from asset details to narrow search results. For example, you may want to find an asset to help you build a new experience for your campaign.

**To search for content to reuse**:

1. In _[!DNL Content]_, select the **[!UICONTROL Assets]** section.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Search]** (magnifying glass) to enter a keyword or description.

1. Narrow your search by selecting a category from the _[!UICONTROL Filter]_ list. For example, if you are looking for a PNG file, click **[!UICONTROL File format]** and choose **PNG**.

   The more you narrow your search, the fewer filter options available. Click **[!UICONTROL Clear all]** to remove all filters.

1. Select an asset for a full view and a list of details.

   Click **[!UICONTROL Download]** (down arrow) to use the asset in your local workstation.
