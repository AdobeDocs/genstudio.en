**To add one or more assets**:

1. In _[!DNL Content]_ mode, click **[!UICONTROL Add assets]**.

1. In the _Add details_ section, select a **[!UICONTROL Campaign name]** or enter a new name.

1. Add more details to improve discoverability.

   The more details that you provide, the more you experience the robust capabilities of GenStudio. Select one or more details from the list, or enter a new one where applicable, such as with keywords. Each detail you add appears below the list. Click `x` to remove a detail.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add assets]**.

## Search

The [!DNL Content] search interface is quick and responsive, and provides a productive search-first experience.

Apply filters and use metadata tags from asset details to narrow search results. For example, you may want to find an asset to help you build a new experience for your campaign.

**To find content for reuse**:
