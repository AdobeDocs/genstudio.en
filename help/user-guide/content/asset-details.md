# Asset details

GenStudio stores approved content with rich metadata for discoverability and performance tracking.

Each asset (including experiences and templates) has associated _details_ (metadata) that help to identify, track, use, and learn from content performance.

## System metadata

Some asset metadata is automatically collected when an asset is uploaded. You cannot edit default system metadata.

Default metadata that is stored and captured for an asset include the file's name, dimensions, source, and more.

### Generated tags

When assets are approved and stored in [!DNL Content], GenStudio uses Adobe's AI and machine learning capabilities to generate tags based on the asset features, such as color and tone, or keywords that identify asset features. You cannot edit tags.

### Generated content metadata

The information used to generate a new asset or experience becomes metadata, such as the prompt that was used. You cannot edit the prompt once the content is approved, but you can use it as a starting place for generating something new.

## User-defined marketing metadata

User-defined marketing metadata adds marketing context to the asset's content, allowing marketers to better understand how to utilize and engage with the asset.

When you [upload an asset](/help/user-guide/content/manage-assets.md#add-assets), you can define a set of optional asset details that exist in GenStudio as metadata.
