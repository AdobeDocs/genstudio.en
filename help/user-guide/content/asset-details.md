# Asset details

Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing stores approved content with rich metadata for discoverability and performance tracking.

Each asset (including experiences and templates) has associated _details_ (metadata) that help to identify, track, use, and learn from content performance.

**To view asset details**:

1. In _[!DNL Content]_, select an asset, experience, or template. Clicking on an asset opens a focused view of the asset.

1. In the asset view, review the _[!UICONTROL Details]_ section on the right.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >If the _[!UICONTROL Details]_ section is not visible, click the **[!UICONTROL Information]** (i) icon.

   Asset details include metadata applied during the creation or upload process. Asset metadata types include [system metadata](#system-metadata) and [user-defined metadata](#user-defined-metadata).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Assets from AEM repositories display different metadata. See [Configure asset visibility](connect-aem-repo.md#step-4-configure-asset-visibility) to learn how to configure [!DNL AEM Assets Content Hub] asset details.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >The more details that you provide, the more you experience the robust capabilities of GenStudio for Performance Marketing. Select one or more details from the list, or enter a new one where applicable, such as with keywords. Each detail you add appears below the list. Click **`x`** to remove a detail.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

## System metadata

Some asset metadata is automatically collected when an asset is uploaded. You cannot edit default system metadata.

Default metadata that is stored and captured for an asset include the file's name, dimensions, source, and more.

### Generated tags

When you store an approved asset in [!DNL Content], GenStudio for Performance Marketing uses Adobe's AI and machine learning capabilities to study the asset and apply tags based on the asset features. For example, a picture of a cat may result in attribute tags like `pet photography` or `cat`, and color tags that identify dominant colors in the picture. You cannot edit tags.

See [Insights Attributes](/help/user-guide/insights/attributes.md).

### Generated content metadata

The information used to generate a new asset or experience becomes metadata, such as the prompt that was used. You cannot edit the prompt once the content is approved, but you can use it as a starting place for generating something new.

## User-defined metadata

User-defined metadata adds marketing context to the asset's content, allowing marketers to understand how to use and engage with the asset.

When you [upload an asset](/help/user-guide/content/manage-assets.md#add-assets), you can define a set of optional asset details that exist in GenStudio for Performance Marketing as metadata. Including more details can improve asset identification in searches and filtering.
