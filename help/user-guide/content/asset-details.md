# Asset details

GenStudio stores approved content with rich metadata for discoverability and performance tracking.

Each asset (including experiences and templates) has associated _details_ (metadata) that help to identify, track, and learn from content performance. The default metadata captured and stored with an asset includes:

- campaign or project name
- channel type
- basic file details (filename, file format, timestamps, size)

**To see asset details**:

1. In _[!DNL Content]_, select an asset.

1. In the asset view, review the _[!UICONTROL Details]_ section on the right.

   If the _[!UICONTROL Details]_ section is not visible, click the **[!UICONTROL Information]** (i) icon.

>[!TIP]
>
>You can view asset details from [!DNL Insights], too. Insights provides usage statistics and performance context across experiences. In _[!DNL Insights]_, select the **[!UICONTROL Assets]** section.

## Details from generated content

The information used to generate a new asset or experience becomes metadata, such as the prompt that was used. You cannot edit the prompt once the content is approved, but you can use it as a starting place for generating something new.

## Generated tags

When assets are approved and stored in [!DNL Content], GenStudio generates tags based on the asset features, such as color and tone, or keywords that identify asset features. You cannot edit tags.
