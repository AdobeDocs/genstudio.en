# Prepare Meta ad template for GenStudio

Creating a Meta ad template involves a structured approach tailored for social media. After a Meta ad template is designed and tested, you can prepare it for upload and use in GenStudio.

## Design a template

Typically, a designer will create the visual design of a template in a design program such as Adobe XD.

See [Anatomy of a template](/help/user-guide/content/use-templates.md#anatomy-of-a-template) and [Template examples](/help/user-guide/content/customize-template.md#template-examples).

### Ad specifications

Familiarize yourself with platform specifications for ad formats and guidelines.

GenStudio supports these aspect ratios for Meta ads:

* Square (1:1): 1080 x 1080 pixels 
* Vertical (4:5): 1080 x 1350 pixels
* Story (9:16): 1080 x 1920 pixels

If the ad is not designed in one of the above aspect ratios, GenStudio automatically crops the image into the appropriate size.  

## Test a Meta ad template

Test your template using Meta's Creative Hub to see how the ad will look in different placements (e.g. feed, stories).

Use your email delivery or proofing platform to test your email and verify that it renders properly across different email clients and devices.

## Define generated content areas

Define the areas in your email template that should be dynamically populated with content from GenStudio. 

To define generated content areas:

* Identify the text elements in the template GenStudio should auto-generate, such as the headline or CTA.
* Adapt your HTML template by inserting placeholders within it using the Handblebars syntax.

See [Content placeholders](/help/user-guide/content/customize-template.md#content-placeholders).

## Preview the template

Control the visibility of specific content areas by utilizing Built-In Helpers. For example, you can include tracking parameters to links in an exported template while maintaining clean preview links.

See [Template preview](/help/user-guide/content/customize-template.md#template-preview).

## Upload and use template

After your template is designed, coded, tested, and previewed, you can upload it to GenStudio for use in generating brand new marketing content.

See [Working with templates](use-templates.md).
