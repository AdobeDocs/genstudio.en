# GenStudio [!DNL Campaigns]

The GenStudio [!DNL Campaigns] feature accelerates the development and deployment of marketing initiatives, or _campaigns_. The [!DNL Campaigns] workflow enhances the development of campaign assets that lend themselves to creation and management by AI-generated workflows, including brand-complaint images and text. It also provides transparency into campaign goals, brand-aligned content, designated channels, and campaign schgit add -Aedules. 

Marketing managers use the [!DNL Campaigns] workflow to create a _campaign brief_ that defines campaign features for all stakeholders who are involved in the creation, review, approval, and deployment of Campaign assets.

## Campaign brief

A GenStudio [!DNL Campaigns] brief describes the essential aspects of a campaign as defined by the campaign creator. Campaign stakeholders use this brief to create and evaluate content. Campaign briefs are dynamic. They change as individual stages of the campaign are deployed and as marketers evaluate the success of each stage. 

## Campaign content

Campaign content consists of approved assets and experiences. 

Once a GenStudio asset or experience has been approved, it can be included in multiple campaigns. You can add content to a campaign by adding a campaign label to an approved asset while:

* Saving an approved asset to [!DNL Content].
* Uploading or importing a file.
* Saving an asset during content creation.
