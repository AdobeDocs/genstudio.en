# GenStudio Campaigns

GenStudio Campaigns accelerates the development and deployment of marketing initiatives, or _campaigns_. Marketing managers can use GenStudio's generative AI-enhanced Campaigns workflow to orchestrate the elements of a marketing initiative that can be created and enhanced by GenStudio stakeholders -- image and text content. The Campaigns workflow provides transparency into campaign goals, brand-aligned content, designated channels, and campaign schedules.
