# GenStudio Campaigns

GenStudio aligns your marketing efforts with a common view of campaigns, briefs and the campaign calendar.

- Save time and effort by ingesting unstructured campaign documents into a structured campaign object and associated metadata to define campaigns in GenStudio and associate the right content with it.
- Easily visualize, plan, and keep track of which campaigns are launching when.
- Send campaign content from GenStudio for comments before it's ready to be approved for activation.
