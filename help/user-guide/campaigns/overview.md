# GenStudio [!DNL Campaigns] 

The GenStudio [!DNL Campaigns] feature accelerates the development and deployment of marketing initiatives, or _campaigns_. The [!DNL Campaigns] workflow enhances the development of campaign assets that lend themselves to creation and management by AI-generated workflows, including brand-compliant images and text. It also provides transparency into campaign goals, brand-aligned content, and designated channels. 

Marketing managers use the [!DNL Campaigns] workflow to create a _campaign brief_ that defines campaign features for all stakeholders who are involved in the creation, review, approval, and deployment of [!DNL Campaign] assets.

## Campaign brief

A GenStudio [!DNL Campaigns] brief describes the essential aspects of a campaign as defined by the [!DNL Campaign] creator. [!DNL Campaign] stakeholders use this brief to create and evaluate content. Campaign briefs are dynamic. They change as individual stages of a campaigns are deployed and as marketers evaluate the success of each stage.

## [!DNL Campaigns] content

[!DNL Campaigns] content consists of approved assets and experiences. 

Once a GenStudio asset or experience has been approved, it can be included in multiple [!DNL Campaigns]. You can add content to a [!DNL Campaign] by adding a [!DNL Campaign] label to an approved asset while:

* Saving an approved asset to [!DNL Content].
* Uploading or importing a file.
* Saving an asset during content creation.
