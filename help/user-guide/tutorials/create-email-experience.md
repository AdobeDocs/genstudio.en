# Create an email experience

This tutorial demonstrates how to generate branded [email experiences](/help/user-guide/create/email-experiences.md) using GenStudio for Performance Marketing [[!DNL Create]](/help/user-guide/create/overview.md) (paintbrush icon in the left navigation area).

To create an effective email experience, it is recommended that you [add guidelines to GenStudio for Performance Marketing](/help/user-guide/guidelines/add-guidelines.md) and brush up on the [basics of crafting a prompt](/help/user-guide/effective-prompts.md) before you begin.

## Choose a template

To create a new email experience, use an available template to provide the framework for your content.

**To choose an email template**:

1. In _[!DNL Create]_, click **[!UICONTROL Email]** in the _"What do you want to create today?"_ section.
1. Use the search option, adjacent to _Filter_, to find a specific email template.
1. Click to select an email template and click **[!UICONTROL Use]**.

   The Canvas, the epicenter of content creation, appears.

## Add parameters

Adding [guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/overview.md) and assets in _Parameters_ in the prompt area supercharges the content generation process and is an integral preparatory step for generating an email experience.

**To add parameters and assets**:

1. Click the _Parameters_ icon to expand the prompt area.
1. In the _Parameters_ section, select guidelines—[!DNL Brands], [!DNL Personas], and [!DNL Products]—to inform content creation.

   If there are no brands, personas, or products available from these menus, [add guidelines to your GenStudio for Performance Marketing](/help/user-guide/guidelines/add-guidelines.md).

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Select content]** to add content to be used in the experience *and* to influence content generation.
   * To select assets (images) from your [!DNL Content] repository, click **[!UICONTROL Select from content]**. Filter and select one or more images.

      To use assets from a connected [!DNL AEM Assets Content Hub] repository, choose a repository from the _Location_ dropdown menu. Filter and select one or more images.

   * To upload one or more new assets, click **[!UICONTROL Upload]**, browse your files, and choose assets to use. Along with browsing your device, you can import from Microsoft OneDrive or Dropbox. Click to select the desired images.
   * Drag and drop assets into the _Content_ section.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Use]**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If your email template has multiple sections, select [!DNL Products] and content (visual assets) for each email section in _Multi-section emails_. Multi-section emails support one visual asset per section.

When you are finished adding parameters, you can collapse the prompt area by clicking the _Parameters_ icon again.

## Enter a prompt

After guidelines are selected, craft a prompt using natural language to start generating content for your new email experience. Detailed prompts yield higher quality output than vague or indescriptive prompts.

See [Write effective prompts](/help/user-guide/effective-prompts.md) to learn more about writing prompts.

**To enter a prompt**:

1. Enter a prompt in the _"Describe the experiences you want to generate"_ prompt box.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Generate]**.

By default, four variations—all fueled by the prompt, guidelines, and content you added—are generated and shown in the Canvas.

Generated content loads progressively—as each section of the email experiences are generated they appear in the Canvas. See [Email experiences](/help/user-guide/create/meta-experiences.md#progressive-loading) to learn how those changes are loaded in the Canvas.

## Revise generated emails

Before selecting what to send for approval or publishing to [!DNL Content] you can edit email sections or delete a variant from the set of generated emails.

**To revise generated variants**:

* **To [edit the email draft name](/help/user-guide/create/manage-variants.md#change-draft-name)**, click into the _Untitled Draft_ title at the top of the Canvas and enter a new title.
* **To [manually edit an email](/help/user-guide/create/manage-variants.md#manually-edit-text)**, double-click into any of the editable text fields (such as the subject line, header, or body copy) and edit as needed
<!-- * **To [regenerate a section of a variant](/help/user-guide/create/manage-variants.md#re-generate-sections)**, click an editable text field and use the _[!UICONTROL Suggested edits]_ options or enter a new prompt and click **[!UICONTROL Generate]**. -->
* **To [add or swap images in a variant](/help/user-guide/create/manage-variants.md#swap-image)**, click an image asset (or the image asset area if an image does not currently exist) and click **[!UICONTROL Select/swap from content]** or **[!UICONTROL Upload New Image]** to add or swap an image in an individual variant.
* **To [delete an email](/help/user-guide/create/manage-variants.md#delete-variant)**, click to select the email title (for example, "Email 1/4") and click **[!UICONTROL Delete variant]**.

## Submit generation feedback

To [submit feedback](/help/user-guide/create/manage-variants.md#generation-feedback) about the quality of the generation output, click the options icon (three dots) and select **[!UICONTROL Good output]** or **[!UICONTROL Poor output]**.

## Preview for device

When revising and preparing email experiences, you can [toggle between previews for desktop and mobile views](/help/user-guide/create/manage-variants.md#preview-for-device) to ensure coherence and visual appeal of draft variants.

## Verify brand alignment

To optimize the generated emails and ensure strict adherence to brand identity, leverage the power of the [_Brand guidelines check_](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md#brand-guidelines-check)—providing a summary of brand alignment for a variant—and the [_Brand validation_ panel](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md#brand-validation-panel)—displaying comprehensive brand validation details and illuminating improvement areas.

**To verify brand alignment**:

1. Click the [**[!UICONTROL [!DNL Brand] guidelines check]**](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md#brand-guidelines-check) icon for a variant and see a summary of how that variant performs when checked against your brand.
1. To get the details of the sections and guidelines that need improvement, click **[!UICONTROL Review]** _or_ click the Brand validation icon in top menu bar to open the [_Brand validation panel_](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md#brand-validation-panel).

1. Toggle through each email to see how you can improve the generated content to be more brand-aligned.
1. [Manually revise emails](#revise-generated-emails) to ensure your emails are closely aligned with your brand.

See [Brand validation](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md).

## Get reviews and approvals

Use the Approvals panel, accessible on the top menu bar of the Canvas, to obtain reviews, track review comments, and get approvals from stakeholders.

**To obtain reviews and approvals**:

1. [Launch an approval request](/help/user-guide/approvals/request-review.md) to solicit an [approval of drafted email experiences](/help/user-guide/approvals/approve-content.md).
1. [Remove or add reviewers](/help/user-guide/approvals/review-and-edit.md#manage-approvals) during the review process.
1. [Access the content for review](/help/user-guide/approvals/review-and-edit.md#access-content-for-review) and view the requests for revision.
1. Edit the drafts per review comments and [publish your email experiences](#publish-and-export-experience).

See [Reviews and approvals](/help/user-guide/approvals/overview.md) for more information.

## Publish and export experience

To make the generated emails available for current and future use, publish it to [!UICONTROL Content] and export it for use in your marketing campaigns.

1. **To publish your new email experience(s)**, click **[!UICONTROL Publish]** in the top toolbar.
1. **To export your new email experience(s)**, click **[!UICONTROL Export]** in the top toolbar.
   1. Select the format—CSV and images or HTML only—and click **[!UICONTROL Export]**.
