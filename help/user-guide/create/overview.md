GenStudio [!DNL Create] satisfies three main use cases:

* **Create new content** - In this use case, use defined [References](/help/user-guide/references/overview.md) (Brands, Products, and Personas) and inspiration content to inform the creation of brand-aligned content.
* **Re-use existing content** - In this use case, upload an existing email, ad, or image to GenStudio and use the power of Adobe generative AI technology to revise and improve existing content.
* **Generate variants of content** - In this use case, generate variations of content based on a target [customer persona](/help/user-guide/references/personas.md). This functionality allows for experimentation and discovery of high-performing content and allows for cross-channel conversion of content (for example, converting an email to a display ad).

## [!DNL Create] capabilities

GenStudio [!DNL Create] integrates various components of GenStudio to assist users in generating content.

### Drafts

In the _Recent work_ section of the [!DNL Create] home, access and manage all recent drafts. Generate variants of previous drafts or complete your work and ready it for publishing to [[!DNL Content]](/help/user-guide/content/overview.md).

### Templates

Access brand-approved templates to generate content across multiple channels in the _Recently used templates_ section of [!DNL Create] home. Use templates to jump start the content creation process and stay aligned with a defined brand identity.

Templates are [created and stored in [!DNL Content]](/help/user-guide/content/overview.md) but are accessible in [!DNL Create].

### Prompts

[Crafting effective prompts](/help/user-guide/effective-prompts.md) is an important part of the generation process in [!DNL Create]. To create new content or generate variants of content, write a prompt that describes the content (or experience) you desire to generate.

Write prompts, add Parameters and Content, and use guided prompt suggestions from within the prompt drawer, then click **Generate**.

### Parameters

In the prompt drawer, you can add **Parameters** such as Brands, Products, and Personas to shape the generated experience. These Parameters inject [References](/help/user-guide/references/overview.md) into the generation process, ensuring that the content is customized to align with a brand's comprehensive identity. Adding Parameters is highly recommended as they greatly enhance the creation of suitable on-brand content.

### Brand validation

GenStudio conducts brand validation on various aspects of a brand's identity (as defined in [References](/help/user-guide/references/overview.md)). Brand validation information is available for any generated content, indicating its compliance with brand guidelines. You can use this information to revise or improve your generated experience to better align with your brand.

See [References documentation](/help/user-guide/references/overview.md) to learn more about brand validation.


### Reviews and approvals

Meticulously review and validate content against brand guidelines, product documentation, and selected customer segments with [!DNL Create's] built-in reviews and approvals process. Solicit reviews, track review comments, and obtain approvals during the creation process.

See the [Activation documentation](/help/user-guide/activation/review-process.md) to learn more about Reviews and Approvals.
