# Create an email experience

In GenStudio's [!DNL Create] mode, you can generate branded email experiences efficiently using Adobe's generative AI and customizable brand references.

Creating a new email experience in GenStudio is a seamless and comprehensive process that combines efficiency with powerful features.

1. [**Select an existing template**](#choose-template).
1. [**Customize the content generation process**](#customize-content-generation) to align with your message, brand, and purpose.
1. [**Manually modify email content**](#modify-email-content) to fine-tune the generated results.
1. [**Create variants**](#create-variants) of the generated emails.
1. [**Employ the built-in brand validation**](#verify-brand-alignment) to ensure consistency and brand adherence.
1. [**Seek reviews and approvals**](#review-and-approval) from stakeholders.
1. [**Publish the email experience**](#publish-experience) to [!DNL Content] and [**export it for use**](#export-experience).

In the left navigation area, click **Create** to begin creating an email experience.

## Choose a template

To get started creating a new email experience, use an available template to provide the framework for your content.

**To choose an email template:**

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Email]** in the "_What do you want to create today?" section.
1. Click to open a template in the _Recent templates_ section, or click **[!UICONTROL View all templates]** to see more available templates.
   1. In the _Select template_ pane, toggle the _Channels_ filter to **[!UICONTROL Email]**.

   Use the search option, adjacent to _Filter_, to find a specific email template.

   1. Click to select an email template, or toggle select multiple email templates, and click **[!UICONTROL Use]**. If you select multiple templates, when the variants are generated all selected templates will be used to provide you options.

   The Canvas, the epicenter of content creation, appears.

## Customize content generation

In the Canvas use the prompt bar, references parameters, and images to inform and customize the content generation process.

### Add parameters

Adding reference parameters supercharges the content generation process and is an integral preparatory step for creating a new email experience.

**To customize content generation for your new email experience:**

1. Click the _Parameters_ icon IMG to begin adding references parameters and image content.
1. In the _Parameters_ section, add brand references to inform content creation.
   1. Choose a **Brand**.
   1. Choose a **Persona**.
   1. Choose a **Product**.

   If there are no brands, personas, or products available from these menus, [add brand references to your GenStudio](/help/user-guide/references/add-references.md).

1. In the _Content_ section, add content to be used in the experience *and* to influence content generation.
   1. Click **[!UICONTROL Select content]** or drop files in the _Content_ section.
   1. **[!UICONTROL Browse your device]** or **[!UICONTROL Select from GenStudio content]** to choose images to use.

   When you select images from GenStudio content, you are choosing from images already saved to [[!DNL Content]](/help/user-guide/content/overview.md). You can filter by channel, product, language, and more, to find the needed images quickly.

When you are done adding parameters, you can collapse the *Parameters* and *Content* sections by clicking the _Parameters_ icon again.

### Use a prompt

After brand references are selected, craft a prompt using natural language to start generating content for your new email experience.

See [Write effective prompts](/help/user-guide/effective-prompts.md) to learn more about writing prompts.

**To create a prompt:**

1. Enter a prompt in the _"Describe the experiences you want to generate"_ prompt box.

   If the prompt box is not visible, click **[!UICONTROL Open to prompt]** to expand it.

1. Optionally, click one of the prompt suggestions visible just above the prompt text box. Clicking a suggestion auto-fills the suggested prompt in the prompt box.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Generate]**.

By default, four generated variations—all fueled by the prompt, reference parameters, and images you added—are shown in the Canvas.

## Modify email content

### Generate variants

Once the initial email experience variants are generated, you have the option to iterate on them by generating another set of variants.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Open to prompt]**.
1. Select new [brand references](/help/user-guide/references/overview.md), add new images, or enter a new prompt in the prompt bar.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Generate]**.

When generating variants, you have the option to add new brand references, images, or prompts. These steps are optional will affect the regenerated result based on what you choose to alter.

See [Generate variants](/help/user-guide/create/generate-variants.md) for more information.

## Verify brand alignment

Use the built-in brand verification tool to verify that all variants are checked against, and agree with, your brand references.

1. Open the brand validation panel and toggle through each email to see how the generated content is checked against your brand references and other GenStudio guidelines.
1. [Manually revise emails](#modify-email-content), or [generate variants](/help/user-guide/create/generate-variants.md), to ensure your emails are closely aligned with your brand.

See [Brand validation](/help/user-guide/references/brand-validation.md) for more information.
