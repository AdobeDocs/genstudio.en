# Meta experiences

<!-- ## Anatomy -->

## Progressive loading

When the content generation process starts, each section of generated content in variants progressively loads in the Canvas. Experiences, assets, and fields and sections within experiences, appear individually in the Canvas as they are generated.

When you click **[!UICONTROL Generate]**, a loading indicator appears at the bottom of the Canvas updating you on the progress of generation.

Each field and section of the Meta ad experiences are progressively loaded in this sequence:

1. The primary text for all variations is progressively loaded.
1. The calls-to-action and associated URLs are progressively loaded.
1. The headlines are progressively loaded.
1. On-image text is progressively loaded.
1. The brand validation process occurs and the [_Brand guidelines check_](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md#brand-guidelines-check) populates for each variant.
