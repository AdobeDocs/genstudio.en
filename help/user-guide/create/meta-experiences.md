# Meta experiences

With Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing, you can use generative AI to streamline the [creation of high-impact Meta experiences](/help/tutorials/create-meta-ad.md).

[!DNL Create] enables content creators to use [guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/overview.md), image assets, and a [well-crafted prompt](/help/user-guide/effective-prompts.md) to quickly [create Meta ad experiences](/help/tutorials/create-meta-ad.md).

Editable sections of an email experience include:

* Headline
* Body
* Call-to-action (CTA)
* On-image text
* Image
* Brand logo

See [Template elements](/help/user-guide/content/use-templates.md#template-elements).

<!-- ## Meta ad capabilities

Content creators and marketers can produce brand-consistent Meta ad experiences in GenStudio for Performance Marketing. -->

## Meta ads channels

When creating Meta ad experiences, you can generate variants for both Facebook and Instagram channels. Toggle back and forth between Facebook and Instagram ads to preview variants for each channel.

See [Choose Meta ads channel](/help/tutorials/create-meta-ad.md#choose-meta-ads-channel).

## Progressive loading

When the content generation process starts, each section of generated content in variants progressively loads in the Canvas. Experiences, assets, and fields and sections within experiences, appear individually in the Canvas as they are generated.

When you click **[!UICONTROL Generate]**, a loading indicator appears at the bottom of the Canvas updating you on the progress of generation.

Each field and section of the Meta ad experiences are progressively loaded in this sequence:

1. The primary text for all variations is progressively loaded.
1. The calls-to-action and associated URLs are progressively loaded.
1. The headlines are progressively loaded.
1. On-image text is progressively loaded.
1. The brand validation process occurs and the [_Brand guidelines check_](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md#brand-guidelines-check) populates for each variant.
