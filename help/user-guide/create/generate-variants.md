# Generate variants

## Email

The four email variants that are generated can be manually modified or regenerated using another prompt, different references parameters, or imagesâ€”or a mix of all the brand references and content in _Parameters_.

**To modify generated email variants:**

1. With generated email variants visible, click **[!UICONTROL Open to prompt]** near the bottom of the screen to expand the prompt bar.
1. Modify _Parameters_:
   1. Choose a **[!UICONTROL Brand]**, **[!UICONTROL Persona]**, or **[!UICONTROL Product]** [brand references](/help/user-guide/references/overview.md).
   1. Add or delete images in the _[!UICONTROL Content]_ section.
   1. Enter a new prompt in the _"Describe the experiences you want to generate"_ prompt box.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Generate]**.

A new set of variants are generated. You can continue to modify, generate, and iterate on variants until you're ready to [publish to [!DNL Content]](#publish-experience) and [export for use](#export-experience).
