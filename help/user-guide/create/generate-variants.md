# Generate variants

When generating variants, you have the option to add new [guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/overview.md), images, or [prompts](/help/user-guide/effective-prompts.md). These steps are optional but will affect the regenerated result based on what you choose to alter.

## Email

By default, GenStudio generates four email variations. They can be manually modified or regenerated using a mix of new prompts and _Parameters_ to achieve stylistic goals or brand adherence.

**To modify generated email variants:**

1. With the generated email variants visible, click **[!UICONTROL Open to prompt]** near the bottom of the screen to expand the prompt bar.
1. Modify _Parameters_:
   1. Choose **[!UICONTROL Brand]**, **[!UICONTROL Persona]**, or **[!UICONTROL Product]** [guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/overview.md).
   1. Add or delete images in the _[!UICONTROL Content]_ section.
   1. Enter a new prompt in the _"Describe the experiences you want to generate"_ prompt box.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Generate]**.

A new set of variants are generated. You can continue to modify, generate, and iterate on variants until you are ready to publish to [!DNL Content] and export for use.
