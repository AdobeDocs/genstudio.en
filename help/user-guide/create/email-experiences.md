# Email experiences

With GenStudio for Performance Marketing, you can use generative AI to streamline the [creation of high-impact email experiences](/help/tutorials/create-email-experience.md).

[!DNL Create] enables modern marketers to quickly use [guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/overview.md), image assets, and a [well-crafted prompt](/help/user-guide/effective-prompts.md) to generate a suite of brand-aligned email variants.

Editable sections of an email include:

* Pre-header
* Headline
* Body
* Call-to-action (CTA)
* Image
* Brand logo

See [Create an email experience](/help/tutorials/create-email-experience.md).

## Email capabilities

### multi pod

### Progressive loading

When the content generation process starts, each section of generated content in variants progressively loads in the Canvas. Experiences, assets, and fields and sections within experiences, appear individually in the Canvas as they are generated.

When you click **[!UICONTROL Generate]**, a loading indicator appears at the bottom of the Canvas updating you on the progress of generation.

Each field and section of email experiences are progressively loaded in this sequence:

1. Variant names are progressively loaded.
1. The subject lines for all variations are progressively loaded.
1. The pre-headers are progressively loaded.
1. The headlines, email body (for single section emails), and calls-to-action are progressively loaded.
1. The email body for subsequent sections (for multi-section emails) is progressively loaded.
1. The brand validation process occurs and the [_Brand guidelines check_](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md#brand-guidelines-check) populates for each variant.
