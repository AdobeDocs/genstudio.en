# Manage variants

Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing [!DNL Create] enables you to customize and enhance generated variants—emails, Meta ads, and more—for use in digital marketing initiatives.

When [creating experiences](/help/tutorials/tutorials.md), you can modify content and assets of generated variants individually or in a batch. The ability to manage variants at the individual micro level allows you to explicitly manage each piece of generated content.

## Change draft name

Generated variant drafts have a default name shown at the top of the Canvas. Default draft names use the following convention that includes the channel type, date, and time of generation.

*Example*: "Meta: Untitled Draft - 09.5.24, 9:56 AM"

**To change the default name**:

1. After generating a set of variants, click into the default _Untitled Draft_ name at the top of the Canvas.
1. Select text and enter a new name.
1. Click off the text field to save it.

## Manually edit text

You can edit the text fields in generated variants. Refine the text for your audience by experimenting with different phrases and verbiage. For example, you can manually revise text in variants to preview the appearance of a headline with a chosen image.

**To manually edit text in generated variants**:

1. After generating a set of variants, double-click editable text in a variant.
1. Enter new text.
1. Click off the text field to save it.

<!-- ## Re-generate sections

GenStudio for Performance Marketing has the built-in functionality to regenerate single sections of generated variants using _[!UICONTROL Suggested edits]_ and fresh prompts.

For example, you can re-generate the headline section of one Meta ad variant to see how it looks with a specific background asset using the _[!UICONTROL Suggested edits]_ options—_[!UICONTROL Rephrase]_, _[!UICONTROL Shorten]_, or _[!UICONTROL Lengthen]_—and entering a new prompt.

**To re-generate individual variant sections**:

1. After generating a set of variants, single-click editable text in a variant.
1. (_Optional_) Enter a new prompt to change the focus of the regenerated content.
1. Select a _[!UICONTROL Suggested edits]_ option—_[!UICONTROL Rephrase]_, _[!UICONTROL Shorten]_, or _[!UICONTROL Lengthen]_.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Generate]**.
1. If you want to regenerate results, click the regenerate icon adjacent to _Results_.
1. From the _Results_ that appear, select the desired option and click **[!UICONTROL Replace]**.

   The variant is updated with the revised text. -->

## Crop assets

You can manually crop and reposition image assets in individual generated variants.

**To crop and reposition images in variants**:

1. After generating a set of variants, hover over an image within a variant.
1. Click to crop icon that appears in the left corner of the image.
1. Adjust the image bounding box and drag the image into the desired position.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Apply]** to apply the crop to a single image or **[!UICONTROL Apply to all images]** to apply to all images in the variants.

   The cropped image is saved and visible for the variants.

## Change aspect ratio

You can quickly change the aspect ratio of Meta ads to accommodate the desired ad sizing.

Available size/aspect ratios are:

* 1:1 square (Meta)
* 4:5 vertical (Meta)
* 9:16 vertical (Meta)
* 250 x 980 (display ad)

>[!NOTE]
>
>Other aspect ratios and sizes may be available based on available templates.

**To change the aspect ratio of generated Meta ads**:

1. After generating a set of variants, select the aspect ratio resize icon (arrow pointing to box corner) on the left side of the Canvas.

   The aspect ratio that is currently used for your ads is shown in the top portion of the _[!UICONTROL Resize]_ window.

   The number of variations affected by this revision are noted in the top right corner of the window. _Example_: "4 of 4 variations"

1. Select an available aspect ratio.

   Only aspect ratio sizes that are not currently represented in the Canvas are available to choose.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Duplicate and resize]**.

  [!DNL Create] builds a copy of each variant based on the new selected aspect ratio. All variants, including ones in the initial aspect ratio, are present in the Canvas.
   
   For instance, if you generate four variants in a 1:1 aspect ratio initially and then change the aspect ratio to 4:5, _eight_ total variants are now available on the Canvas.

## Preview for device

When revising and preparing email experiences, you can toggle between previews for desktop and mobile views to ensure coherence and visual appeal of draft variants.

**To preview variants for desktop and mobile devices**, toggle the device preview option—between **desktop** and **mobile—in** the right menu bar (computer and phone icons) to preview how variants appear.

## Delete variant

You can delete any generated variants that you do not plan to save or reuse.

Delete needless variants so that the working Canvas shows only the variants you are actively refining or using.

**To delete a generated variant**:

1. After generating a set of variants, click on the name above a variant.

   The variant is highlighted and a shortcut menu appears.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Delete]** from the available menu options.

   The variant is deleted.

## Brand validation per variant

Use the _[!UICONTROL Brand guidelines check]_ and the _[!UICONTROL Brand validation panel]_ to maintain consistent brand identity and alignment of variants.

See [Brand validation](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brand-validation.md#improve-brand-alignment).
