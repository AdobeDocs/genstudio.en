# Overview of Brands

There are multiple possible scopes that a brand might describe - it might describe an entire company, or a particular product within a company, or a particular advertising campaign for a product.

We can model this via a hierarchy of brand libraries, where a brand library can inherit from another brand library, to add to or override aspects of it. For example, a campaign for a product can inherit the general brand guidelines for the product, while also adding campaign-specific context. We can see this brand hierarchy if we take an example like Coca Cola:

## Create a Brand

### Sample brand guide

### Add a Brand manually

## Modify a Brand

## Publish a Brand

## Brand review process

## Brand verification
