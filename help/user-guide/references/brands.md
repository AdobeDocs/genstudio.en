# Overview of Brands

There are multiple possible scopes that a brand might describe, such as an entire company, a particular product within a company, or a particular advertising campaign for a product.

GenStudio builds on a hierarchy of brand libraries that can inherit from another brand library, adding to or overriding aspects of it. For example, a campaign for a product can inherit the general brand guidelines for the product, while also adding campaign-specific context. The following example illustrates this brand hierarchy:

## Sample brand guide

While you can manually add brand references to GenStudio, it is recommended to create the brand references by uploading brand guideline documents. When you upload brand documents, GenStudio parses and logs each aspect of your brand, from one or many files, and uses it to formulate your brand overview.
