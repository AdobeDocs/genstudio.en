# Overview of Brands

There are multiple possible scopes that a brand might describe, such as an entire company, a particular product within a company, or a particular advertising campaign for a product.

GenStudio builds on a hierarchy of brand libraries that can inherit from another brand library, adding to or overriding aspects of it. For example, a campaign for a product can inherit the general brand guidelines for the product, while also adding campaign-specific context. The following example illustrates this brand hierarchy:

## Create a Brand

### Sample brand guide

### Add a Brand manually

## Modify a Brand

## Publish a Brand

## Brand review process

## Brand verification

A green brand verification logo indicts that the content in that particular email was verified against your brand information and passed verification. An orange brand verification logo indicates there are some potential improvements to be made to ensure the email is aligned with your brand.
