# Overview of Brands

A brand distinguishes an organization, product, service or concept from others. Some aspects of a brand are objective, like a logo, while others are subjective, like tone of voice. GenStudio uses the wealth of brand information from your brand, partners it with product and persona information, and builds out a comprehensive brand identity. This brand identity, called [brand references](overview.md) in GenStudio, is used to inform the creation of on-brand content using Adobe's generative AI technology.
<!-- GenStudio builds on a hierarchy of brand libraries that can inherit from another brand library, adding to or overriding aspects of it. For example, a campaign for a product can inherit the general brand guidelines for the product, while also adding campaign-specific context. The following example illustrates this brand hierarchy: -->

To [create your own brand in GenStudio](add-references#add-brands.md), you either upload brand guideline documents or manually add brand details right into GenStudio.

In GenStudio's **Brands**, click into a defined brand to see its brand overview.
