# GenStudio Brand references

GenStudio references encompass three key elements: **Brands**, **Products**, and **Personas**. These Brand references can be either uploaded or manually added to GenStudio, allowing users to establish brand guidelines that capture the essence of a brand's identity. By incorporating these user-defined brand references, GenStudio ensures that any AI-generated content is tailored to align with the unique brand identity, enabling effective personalization of content.

To create compelling marketing content using GenStudio, start by building a comprehensive brand profile by adding [Brands](/help/user-guide/references/brands.md), [Products](/help/user-guide/references/products.md), and [Personas](/help/user-guide/references/personas.md).

## Capabilities

GenStudio Brands, Products, and Personas:

* Define the complexities of your brand identity
* Create the base repository of brand information with guidelines for discreet elements such as logos and fonts, pixel spacing, and the subtlety of messaging guidelines
* Ensure that your defined brand identity informs the creation of each piece of content
* Operate as a brand identity framework that GenStudio checks against with each piece of generated or [validated content](#brand-validation)

By incorporating Brand, Product, and Personas data into GenStudio, you can greatly improve the quality and impact of the content generated using the AI functionality. Adding these references to GenStudio ensures a comprehensive and tailored brand identity, resulting in more impactful content when implemented.

## Use cases

Brand references enable two main use cases to ensure any generated content adheres to a brand's desired representation:

* **Content generation** in GenStudio's [Create](/help/user-guide/create/overview.md) or [Content](/help/user-guide/content/overview.md) modes
* [**Brand validation**](#brand-validation), which happens as part of the content creation process

## Brand validation

In collaboration with Adobe's generative AI functionality, Brands, Products, and Personas play a crucial role in ensuring that all of your GenStudio content aligns with your brand identity.

GenStudio conducts brand validation on various brand aspects and provides a checklist for generated content to highlight improvement areas to better align with your brand identity.

See [Brand validation](/help/user-guide/references/brand-validation.md).
