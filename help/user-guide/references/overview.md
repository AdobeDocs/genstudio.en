# GenStudio brand references overview

GenStudio references consist of **Brands**, **Products**, and **Personas**. These brand references can be uploaded or manually added to GenStudio to create a references library of guides, which serves as a comprehensive representation of a brand's identity. This user-defined brand references ensure that any AI-generated content in GenStudio is customized to align with the specific brand identity, enabling effective personalization of content.

To create compelling marketing content using GenStudio, start by building a comprehensive brand profile by adding [Brands](/help/user-guide/references/brands.md), [Products](/help/user-guide/references/products.md), and [Personas](/help/user-guide/references/personas.md).

## Capabilities

GenStudio Brands, Products, and Personas:

* Define the complexities of your brand identity
* Create the base repository of brand information with guidelines for discreet elements such as logos and fonts, pixel spacing, and the subtlety of messaging guidelines
* Ensure that your defined brand identity informs the creation of each piece of content
* Operate as a brand identity framework that GenStudio checks against with each piece of generated or [validated content](#brand-validation)

By incorporating Brand, Product, and Personas data into GenStudio, you can significantly enhance the quality and effectiveness of the content generated using the AI functionality. You can generate assets without uploading any brand reference material but adding them to GenStudio ensures a comprehensive and tailored brand identity, resulting in more impactful content upon implementation.

* **Content generation** in GenStudio's [Create](/help/user-guide/create/overview.md) or [Content](/help/user-guide/content/overview.md) modes
* [**Brand validation**](#brand-validation), which happens as part of the content creation process
