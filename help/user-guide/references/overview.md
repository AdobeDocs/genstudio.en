# GenStudio [!DNL References]

GenStudio References consist of **Brands**, **Products**, and **Personas**. These References can be uploaded or manually added to GenStudio to create a References library, which serves as a comprehensive representation of a brand's identity. This user-defined References library ensures that any AI-generated content in GenStudio is customized to align with the specific brand identity, enabling effective personalization of content.

To create compelling marketing content using GenStudio, start by building a comprehensive brand profile in References by adding [Brands](/help/user-guide/references/brands.md), [Products](/help/user-guide/references/products.md), and [Personas](/help/user-guide/references/personas.md).

## Capabilities

GenStudio Brands, Products, and Personas:

* Define the complexities of your brand identity

* Create the base repository of brand information with guidelines for discreet elements such as logos and fonts, pixel spacing, and the subtlety of messaging guidelines
* Ensure that your defined brand identity informs the creation of each piece of content
* Operate as a brand identity framework that GenStudio checks against with each piece of generated or [validated content](#brand-validation)

By incorporating Brand, Product, and Personas data into GenStudio, you can significantly enhance the quality and effectiveness of the content generated using the AI functionality. You can generate assets without uploading any brand reference material but adding them to GenStudio ensures a comprehensive and tailored brand identity, resulting in more impactful content upon implementation.

## Use cases

Brands, Products, and Personas ([Parameters in the prompt drawer](/help/user-guide/create/overview.md#prompts)), enable two main use cases to ensure any generated content adheres to a brand's desired representation:

* **Content generation** in GenStudio's [Create](/help/user-guide/create/overview.md) or [Content](/help/user-guide/content/overview.md) modes
* [**Brand validation**](#brand-validation), which happens as part of the content creation process

## Brand validation

In collaboration with the generative AI functionality, Brands, Products, and Personas play a crucial role in ensuring that all of your GenStudio content aligns with your brand identity. GenStudio conducts brand validation on various brand aspects, including:

* **Customer-specific** - Brand guidelines
* **Channel platform** - Copy guidelines
* **Ethical AI** - Gender, ethnicity and race, disability status, age
* **Quality** - Plagiarism, grammar rules, correctness of human features in imagery, GenAI hallucinations (factuality)

While in [Create mode](/help/user-guide/create/overview.md), brand validation information is available for any generated content.

A Brand Validation icon displays for each generated email or image, indicating its compliance with brand guidelines.
