# Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketers [!DNL Insights]

Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketers [!DNL Insights] provides advanced analytics and insights into content performance that can help you make data-driven decisions.

From the [!DNL Insights] dashboard, you can:

- **Identify the most effective content**: Pinpoint which content performs best for different audiences and tailor future content or campaigns for trending preferences.
- **Optimize low-performing content**: Find content that is not performing well and use the integrated generative AI to create variations immediately, potentially improving its effectiveness without starting from scratch.
- **Revitalize high-performing content**: Take successful content and tweak it to refresh the experience for the audience or adapt hero content for use in new campaigns, potentially extending its lifecycle and performance.

## Dashboard

The [!DNL Insights] dashboard has a configurable grid for each content type: Channels, Experiences, Assets, and Attributes.

Each view displays a corresponding grid, which you can search by keyword, filtering, and date range. You can click the cog icon above the right side of the table to toggle the viewable column types. The _[!UICONTROL Summary]_ row may show totals or averages of a column.

See [Data columns for [!DNL Insights]](data-columns.md) for a description of each column type in the grid.

### Channels

The [!DNL Insights] _[!UICONTROL Channels]_ view is the default view and shows a list of active campaign details, such as objectives, budget, launch date, and activity.

### Experiences

The [!DNL Insights] _[!UICONTROL Experiences]_ view concentrates on evaluating the effectiveness of an experience. This view enables you to analyze an experience's metrics based on its ad placement within a specified date range. By clicking on **[!UICONTROL View asset performance]**, you can access a list of assets used in the selected experience, allowing you to identify which components have contributed to its overall success.

### Assets

The [!DNL Insights] _[!UICONTROL Assets]_ view is designed to help you analyze the performance of assets. You can identify attributes of an asset that contribute to improving a selected metric, such as clicks or impressions.

Clicking on an asset provides further context about its performance across different experiences:

In the asset view, the left side shows a close up of the asset and a list of attributes. There are three highlighted metrics: `Click-through rate`, `Cost per click`, and `Spend`. The performance highlights show how actual values (solid line) compare to the average value (dotted line) over the selected time period (default is `Last 30 days`).

### Attributes

Content _attributes_ help to identify assets by inherent details, such as color, tone, composition (subject, fonts, visual elements), and other key components. Attributes are often the least measured and analyzed set of content information.

The [!DNL Insights] _[!UICONTROL Attributes]_ view can help you investigate and identify which attributes perform better with certain audiences, channels, regions, and highlight seasonal trends. With these insights, you can use performant attributes to create variants, target a specific audience, or experiment with different campaign strategies.
