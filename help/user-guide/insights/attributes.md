### Metrics detail

The following table provides definitions and insights for key digital marketing metrics in the [!UICONTROL Assets] view. Each metric includes a brief definition as it relates to an asset, how the metric is calculated, and one or more insights to help understand its significance and impact on an asset.

| Metric                 | Definition                    | Insight                          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **[!UICONTROL Attribute]**   |  |  |
| **[!UICONTROL Category]**    |  |  |
| **[!UICONTROL # of images]** |  |  |
| **[!UICONTROL # of videos]** |  |  |
| **[!UICONTROL Impressions]** | Impressions are counted each time the asset loads on screen, regardless of interaction or viewing. | A high impression count can indicate broad visibility, but for true performance insight, consider with other engagement metrics. |
| **[!UICONTROL Clicks]**      | Number of times users interact with a clickable element in an ad. Clicks can include clicking a page profile or picture, post reaction, shares, comments, or to expand media to full screen. | A high click count indicates strong interest and engagement with the content, which may be effective and reaching the right audience. |
| **[!UICONTROL CTR]**         | Percentage (%) of users who clicked on an ad.<br>**Calculation**: `clicks` divided by `impressions` | A high click-through rate indicates that the content is highly relevant and motivating to the audience in the messaging and design, and is effectively targeting the audience's interests. |
| **[!UICONTROL CPM]**         | Performance measurement for cost ($) per thousand ad impressions.<br>**Calculation**: total amount `spent` divided by reach, then multiplied by 1000  | A low value may indicate cost-effective visibility, especially when paired with a high click-through rate. |
| **[!UICONTROL CPC]**         | Average cost ($) associated with each click in an experience.<br>**Calculation**: total amount `spent` divided by `clicks` | Lower average costs may indicate cost-efficient ad spend, especially when compared with a rise in conversions. |
| **[!UICONTROL Spend]**       | The amount ($) spent from the budget as it relates to  over a given period of time. | A high spend amount in a short period may indicate rapid usage, which could lead to early depletion of resources. Track the spend amount against key performance metrics to help monitor the overall return on investment. |
