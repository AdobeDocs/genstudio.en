# Channels overview

The [!DNL Insights] _[!UICONTROL Channels]_ view shows a list of campaigns for the connected channel ad account.

>[!TIP]
>
>GenStudio for Performance Marketers requires you to connect to a channel account to begin receiving data. See [Connect channel account](connect-channel.md).

The [!UICONTROL Channels] table is organized using the channel-based ad campaign. The filter (funnel) icon above the left side of the table opens the **[!UICONTROL Filter]** menu where you can select from the [!UICONTROL Account], [!UICONTROL Status], and [!UICONTROL Objective] lists to filter the campaigns in the table.

 When you select a campaign, the [!UICONTROL Experiences] tab opens to a list of ad names associated with that campaign.

## Objectives

At the time that you created a campaign with Meta Ads, you may have selected an objective that aligned with your business goals. There are six objectives from Meta Ads visible in GenStudio for Performance Marketers:

1. **Awareness**: Reach out to the maximum audience and bring awareness to your business.
1. **Traffic**: Increase traffic to your site or application.
1. **Engagement**: Interact with existing and potential customers.
1. **Leads**: Build connections to expand your audience.
1. **App promotion**: Promote your application.
1. **Sales**: Focus on reaching the people mostly likely to use your product.

## Metrics

Depending on your performance goals, Insights metrics can help you evaluate whether you are achieving your objective.

For example, if awareness is your objective, then an increase in the rate of `impressions` may indicate that you are expanding your reach. To understand if that is achieving your objective, you could look at metrics that indicate your content is engaging, such as `clicks` or `video plays`. How effectively is your audience interacting with your content? 

### Channel metrics table

| Metric      | Definition                    | Insight                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Impressions | Impressions are counted each time content loads on screen, regardless of interaction or viewing. | High impressions can indicate broad visibility, but for true performance insight, consider with other engagement metrics. |
| Clicks      | The number of times users interact with a clickable element, such as a link or an ad. | High clicks indicate strong interest and engagement with the content, which may be effective and reaching the right audience. |
| CTR         | The percentage (%) of users who clicked on an ad, search result, or links within an email.<br>**Calculation**: `clicks` divided by `impressions` | A high click-through rate indicates that the content is highly relevant and motivating to the audience in the messaging and design, and is effectively targeting the audience's interests. |
| CPM         | A performance measurement for cost ($) per thousand ad impressions.<br>**Calculation**: total amount `spent` divided by reach, then multiplied by 1000  | A low value can indicate cost-effective visibility, especially when paired with a high click-through rate. |
| CPC         | The average cost ($) associated with each click in an experience.<br>**Calculation**: total amount `spent` divided by `clicks` | Low costs may indicate cost-efficient ad spend, especially when compared with a rise in conversions. |
| Video Plays | Percentage of viewers who watched a video to the end. | High video plays indicate that the video is capturing attention, and can mean that the thumbnail, title, or placement is effectively drawing in viewers. High completion rates suggest that your video content is compelling and relevant. |
| Budget      | The total funds allocated for an ad campaign to achieve campaign goals. | A high budget means more resources for broader reach and potentially greater impact. |
| Spend       | The amount spent from the budget over a given period of time. | A high spend amount in a short period may indicate rapid usage, which could lead to early depletion of resources. Track the spend amount against key performance metrics to help monitor the overall return on investment. |
