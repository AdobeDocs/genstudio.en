## Objectives

At the time that you created a campaign with Meta Ads, you may have selected an objective that aligned with your business goals. There are six objectives from Meta Ads visible in GenStudio for Performance Marketers:

1. **Awareness**: Reach out to the maximum audience and bring awareness to your business.
1. **Traffic**: Increase traffic to your site or application.
1. **Engagement**: Interact with existing and potential customers.
1. **Leads**: Build connections to expand your audience.
1. **App promotion**: Promote your application.
1. **Sales**: Focus on reaching the people mostly likely to use your product.

## Metrics

Depending on your performance goals, Insights metrics can help you evaluate whether you are achieving your objective.

For example, if awareness is your objective, then an increase in the rate of `impressions` may indicate that you are expanding your reach. To understand if that is achieving your objective, you could look at metrics that indicate your content is engaging, such as `clicks` or `video plays`. How effectively is your audience interacting with your content?
