# Experiences overview

The [!DNL Insights] _[!UICONTROL Experiences]_ view shows a list of experiences for the connected channel ad account. For Facebook, the experiences are Meta ad names.

The _[!UICONTROL Experiences]_ table is organized using [!UICONTROL Ad names]. Click the settings (cog) icon above the right side of the table to toggle the viewable columns. The filter (funnel) icon above the left side of the table opens the **[!UICONTROL Filter]** menu where you can select from the [!UICONTROL Account] and [!UICONTROL Campaign] lists to filter the ad names in the table.

## Experience details

Select an experience (ad name) and view the performance metrics and text attributes associated with the experience. In the details view, you can analyze an experience's metrics based on its ad placement within a specified date range.

The details view includes a metrics overall ad `click-through rate`, `cost per click`, and how much of the budget has been `spent` on the ad. Since ads can have multiple placements, such as a feed or a banner, you can see a breakdown of the same metrics for each ad placement. Use the left and right arrows under **[!UICONTROL Performance by ad placement]** to cycle through the ad placement metrics.

### Text attributes

Below the experience preview is a list of [!UICONTROL Text attributes] associated with the ad. When assets and experiences are approved and stored in [!DNL Content], GenStudio for Performance Marketing generates tags based on their inherent features. See [Asset details](../content/asset-details.md#system-metadata) for details about system metadata.

| **[!UICONTROL CPC]**         | Average cost ($) associated with each click in an experience.<br>**Calculation**: total amount `spent` divided by `clicks` | Lower average costs may indicate cost-efficient ad spend, especially when compared with a rise in conversions. |
