# Assets overview

The [!DNL Insights] _[!UICONTROL Assets]_ view shows a list of assets used in experiences and ad campaigns for the selected channel account.

The _[!UICONTROL Assets]_ gallery is the default view that shows a collage of asset previews and a metric, such as click-through rate. Click the settings (cog) icon above the right side of the gallery to toggle the viewable metric: `click-through rate`, `cost per click`, or `spend`.

The _[!UICONTROL Assets]_ table is organized using [!UICONTROL Asset ID]. The filter (funnel) icon above the left side of the table opens the **[!UICONTROL Filter]** menu where you can select from the [!UICONTROL Account], [!UICONTROL Campaign], [!UICONTROL Ads], and [!UICONTROL Asset types] lists to filter the assets in the table.

You can toggle between the views using the view list (table) icon and the grid view (gallery) icon.

| **[!UICONTROL Asset ID]**  |  | |
| **[!UICONTROL Impressions]** | A count of each time the asset loads on screen, regardless of interaction or viewing. | A high impression count can indicate broad visibility, but for true performance insight, consider with other engagement metrics. |
| **[!UICONTROL Clicks]**      | Number of times users interact with a clickable element in an ad. Clicks can include clicking a page profile or picture, post reaction, shares, comments, or to expand media to full screen. | A high click count indicates strong interest and engagement with the content, which may be effective and reaching the right audience. |
| **[!UICONTROL CTR]**         | Percentage (%) of users who clicked on an ad.<br>**Calculation**: `clicks` divided by `impressions` | A high click-through rate indicates that the content is highly relevant and motivating to the audience in the messaging and design, and is effectively targeting the audience's interests. |
| **[!UICONTROL CPM]**         | Cost ($) per thousand ad impressions.<br>**Calculation**: total amount `spent` divided by reach, then multiplied by 1000  | A low value may indicate cost-effective visibility, especially when paired with a high click-through rate. |
| **[!UICONTROL CPC]**         | Average cost ($) associated with each click in an experience.<br>**Calculation**: total amount `spent` divided by `clicks` | Lower average costs may indicate cost-efficient ad spend, especially when compared with a rise in conversions. |
| **[!UICONTROL Spend]**       | The amount ($) spent from the budget as it relates to individual assets over a given period of time. | A high spend amount in a short period may indicate rapid usage, which could lead to early depletion of resources.
