These notes highlight significant Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketers fixes and enhancements for the week ending August 30.

## Highlights

* Instagram and Facebook channel guidelines have been combined into Meta brand guidelines.

* Navigation elements have been enhanced to support user focus while performing tasks throughout the product, including these product areas:

  * Asset, Experience, Template details in ([!DNL Content])
  * Experience, Asset, Attribute detail in ([!DNL Insights])
  * Brand details in ([!DNL Brands])
  * Product and Persona details in ([!DNL Products]) and ([!DNL Personas]) <!-- GS-1189 -->

* Users no longer need to click the **[!UICONTROL Refresh]** button to see updates to Experiences in ([!DNL Content]). <!-- GS-4218 -->
