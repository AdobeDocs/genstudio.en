# Write effective prompts

Communicating with the generative AI is essential to working effectively in GenStudio.

GenStudio provides a generative AI prompt each time there is an opportunity to create or modify an asset. You can use natural language to articulate your ideas and create new experiences.

## Descriptive language

Your prompt guides the AI to generate images that complement your vision. The more details that you provide, the greater the chance of producing an image that meets your needs. Use clear and descriptive language to provide as much detail as possible. Use words that describe ambiance, mood, color, composition, and style.

For example, the following image prompts use descriptive language:

- "_A serene beach scene at dawn with soft pastel colors, gentle waves, and a clear sky with a few scattered clouds, in a hand-drawn style._"

- "_A bustling cityscape at night with neon lights, tall skyscrapers, and busy streets, in a hyper-realistic style._"

- "_A fantasy forest with towering trees, glowing mushrooms, and mystical creatures, in a vibrant, colorful style._"

## Prompt criteria

In the GenStudio [Create](./create/overview.md) mode, you can use **[!UICONTROL Prompt criteria]** to add details through selection to improve the AI interpretation. You can choose from your company references, such as **[!DNL Brand]** or a specific **[!DNL Persona]** or **[!DNL Product]**, and specify image characteristics, such as aspect ratio.
