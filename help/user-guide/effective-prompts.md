# Write effective prompts

Communicating with the generative AI is essential to working effectively in Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketers.

GenStudio for Performance Marketers provides a generative AI prompt each time there is an opportunity to modify an asset. The components of an effective prompt should include descriptive language, examples, and information not provided through your configured guidelines.

As a best practice, supply GenStudio for Performance Marketers with your brand information using [guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/overview.md), then you can fully leverage the generative AI to produce brand-aligned content experiences.

## Descriptive language

You can use natural language to articulate your ideas to create experiences. Your prompt guides the AI to generate channel content that is personalized and images that complement your vision. The more details that you provide, the greater the chance of producing an image or an experience that meets your needs. Use clear and descriptive language to provide as much detail as possible:

- For **images**, use words that describe ambiance, mood, color, composition, and style.
- For **copy**, use words that describe the audience, purpose, new feature descriptions, examples, and actions.

The following is a sample prompt that articulates information about your intent, target audience, and style.

```bash
Write an email to motivate infrequent users of Photoshop to follow an in-app tutorial that teaches them to combine elements of two photos into a beautiful work of art. Highlight the generative AI capabilities of Photoshop and use references to natural imagery.
```

## Prompt criteria

In GenStudio for Performance Marketers [[!DNL Create]](/help/user-guide/create/overview.md), you can use **[!UICONTROL Prompt criteria]** ([_Parameters_](/help/user-guide/create/overview.md#parameters) and a prompt) in the prompt area to add details through selection to improve the AI interpretation.

For [emails](/help/tutorials/create-email-experience.md), the prompt criteria might include adding [guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/overview.md) in _Parameters_, upload of an asset to use in the email variants, and a descriptive prompt. For a [Meta ad](/help/tutorials/create-meta-ad.md), the prompt criteria might include a brand guideline in _Parameters_, selection or upload of an existing asset, settings related to images or assets such as aspect ratio, and a prompt. The real power begins with [configuring guidelines](/help/user-guide/guidelines/add-guidelines.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>If guidelines are added in _Parameters_ in the prompt area, you do not need to include reference to those in your prompt. GenStudio for Performance Marketers will leverage those [!DNL Brands], [!DNL Products], and [!DNL Personas] in content generation.

### Guidelines

GenStudio for Performance Marketers guidelines help the generative AI to personalize your asset composition. When presented with prompt criteria, you can choose a [[!DNL Brand]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/brands.md), a [[!DNL Persona]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/personas.md), and a [[!DNL Product]](/help/user-guide/guidelines/products.md) from your configured guidelines.
