# Write effective prompts

Communicating with the generative AI is essential to working effectively in GenStudio.

GenStudio provides a generative AI prompt each time there is an opportunity to create or modify an asset. You can use natural language to articulate your ideas to create new experiences. The components of an effective prompt include:

- use descriptive language
- provide examples and links

As a best practice, supply GenStudio with your brand information using [Brand references](../user-guide/references/overview.md), then you can fully leverage the generative AI to produce brand-aligned content.

## Descriptive language

Your prompt guides the AI to generate channel content that is personalized and images that complement your vision. The more details that you provide, the greater the chance of producing an image or an experience that meets your needs. Use clear and descriptive language to provide as much detail as possible:

- For **images**, use words that describe ambiance, mood, color, composition, and style.
- For **copy**, use words that describe the audience, voice and tone, purpose, examples, and actions.

The following is a sample prompt that articulates information about your intent, target audience, style, 

```terminal
Write an email to motivate infrequent users of Photoshop to follow an in-app tutorial that teaches them to combine elements of two photos into a beautiful work of art. Highlight the generative AI capabilities of Photoshop and use references to natural imagery.
```

## Prompt criteria

In the GenStudio [[!DNL Create]](./create/overview.md) mode, you can use **[!UICONTROL Prompt criteria]** to add details through selection to improve the AI interpretation. For on-brand images, the prompt criteria might include general settings related to images, such as aspect ratio. For channels, you might select a template, or choose a [[!DNL Brand]](../user-guide/references/brands.md), a [[!DNL Persona]](../user-guide/references/personas.md), or [[!DNL Product]](../user-guide/references/products.md) from references guides.
