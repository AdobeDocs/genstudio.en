# Approve content

Approvers receive in-product notifications, email, and if enabled, Slack notifications when their review and approval is needed. Notifications provide a link to the Canvas that displays the content under review. See [Account preferences and notifications](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/core-services/interface/features/account-preferences) for information about managing your notifications.

If the content draft meets your organization's standards and your expectations, you are ready to approve the draft. 

**To approve a draft**:

1. Access the draft from either the in-product notification or by clicking the notification email's **[!UICONTROL View all notifications]** button to navigate to the draft.

1. (_Optional_). Enter comments in the **[!UICONTROL Comments]** text field.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Approved]**. 

Your work as an approver is done. Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing alerts the draft creator of your approval. See [Publish content](./publish-content.md) for an overview of the process of saving to [!DNL Content], or _publishing_.
