# Approve content

Approvers receive in-product, email, and Slack notifications (if enabled) notifications when their review and approval is needed. Both notifications provide a link to the Canvas that displays the content under review. See [Account preferences and notifications](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/core-services/interface/features/account-preferences) for information about managing your notifications.

If the content draft meets your organization's standards and your expectations, you are ready to approve the draft.
