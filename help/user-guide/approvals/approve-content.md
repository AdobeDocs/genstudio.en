# Approve content

Approvers receive both in-product and email notifications when their review and approval is needed. Both notifications provide a link to the Canvas that displays the content under review. 

If the content draft meets your organization's standards and your expectations, you are ready to approve the draft. 

**To approve a draft**:

1. Access the draft from either the in-product or email notification. If you have been asked to review more than one item, this email includes a **[!UICONTROL View all notifications]** button. Click this button to see a linked list of all pending approval requests, which you can use to navigate to content you want to approve.

1. (_Optional_). Enter comments in the Comments text field.

1. Change draft status from **Needs work** to **Approved**. 

Your work as an approver is done. GenStudio alerts the draft creator of your approval.
