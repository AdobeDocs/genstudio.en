# Approve content

Approvers receive both in-product and email notifications when they have been requested to review and approval content. Both notifications provide a link to the Canvas that displays the content under review. 

If the content draft meets your organization's standards and your expectations, you are ready to approve the draft. 

**To approve a draft**:

1. Access the draft from either the in-product and email notification. (If you have been asked to review more than one item, this email includes a **View all notifications** button. You can click this button to see a linked list of all pending approval requests, which you can use to navigate to content you want to approve.)

1. (Optional). Enter comments in the Comments text field.

1. Change draft status from **Needs work** to **Approved**. 

Your work as an approver is done. GenStudio alerts the draft creator of your approval.
