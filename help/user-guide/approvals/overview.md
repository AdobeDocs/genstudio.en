# GenStudio reviews and approvals

GenStudio's review and approvals workflow ensures that all stakeholders—  from creative teams to legal experts—  can efficiently review and approve campaign components, including generative AI-produced brand assets.

## GenStudio [!DNL Review and Approval] workflow advantages

* **Support for robust, iterative generative AI content creation**. Creating and deploying brand-aligned content in an organization is a highly iterative process. GenStudio's generative AI capabilities support the quick creation of hundreds of asset variants. Each reviewer might request multiple changes to an asset draft before approving it. The more reviewers, the greater the number of potential iterations before all stakeholders agree on a final variant.   

* **Support for creative integrity and brand compliance**. Approvals safeguard the creative integrity of your brand assets. By involving stakeholders in the review process, you ensure that final output aligns with your vision and brand identity. Consistent branding is essential for building trust and recognition. Approvals ensure that all materials adhere to brand guidelines.

* **Adherence to Campaign goals and legal requirements**. The approval process helps verify that content supports campaign goals. It ensures that content meets legal authenticity, minimizing risks and potential legal issues.

## Review and approval life cycle


## About GenStudio Content drafts 

_Drafts_ are preliminary versions of assets or experiences that have not undergone the review and approval process. Drafts are identified by unique draft IDs, which are valid until a draft is approved and published to [!DNL Content]. Review comments and approvals for a draft are associated with the individual draft ID. 

When a draft completes the review and approval process and is published to [!DNL Content], the draft ID expires, and GenStudio does not save associated comments and approval statuses. The draft URL is no longer valid.

### Content draft status

Draft status captures the state of the content draft as it moves through the review and approval process. All designated reviewers are notified of changes in the status of content they are reviewing. Reviewers change draft status to indicate whether a draft needs further revision or can be approved.

Available draft statuses:

**Active** -- Content creator has started the review process by identifying reviewers and notifying them that a draft is ready for review.
**Needs work** -- Indicates that one or more reviewers has requested changes to the content draft. Content with this status cannot be saved to [!DNL Content].
**Approved** -- Content has been reviewed and approved by all designated reviewers. The content creator can now add metadata to the asset or experience and save it to [!DNL Content].

## Notifications

GenStudio's in-product notifications update reviewers and content creators in real time of asset status changes and review comments. Notifications support speedy iteration through the multiple review, edit, and approval cycles.

Actions taken by review participants trigger automatic in-product notifications and email notifications. When a content creator starts a review, designated reviewers receive both email and in-product notifications. Creators are kept in the loop with in-product notifications whenever a reviewer adds comments or approves. Notifications include links to the content draft.
