# GenStudio reviews and approvals

## Support for robust, iterative generative AI content creation

Creating and deploying brand-aligned content in an organization is a highly iterative process. GenStudio's generative AI capabilities supports the quick creation of hundreds of asset variants. Each reviewer might request multiple changes to an asset draft before approving it. The more reviewers, the greater the number of potential iterations before all stakeholders agree on a final variant.

By involving stakeholders in the review process, you ensure that final output aligns with your vision and brand identity. Consistent branding is essential for building trust and recognition.
