# GenStudio reviews and approvals

GenStudio's review and approvals workflow ensures that all stakeholders— from creative teams to legal experts— can efficiently review and approve campaign components, including generative AI-produced brand assets.

## GenStudio [!DNL Review and Approval] workflow advantages

* **Support for robust, iterative generative AI content creation**. Creating and deploying brand-aligned content in an organization is a highly iterative process. GenStudio's generative AI capabilities support the quick creation of hundreds of asset variants. Each reviewer might request multiple changes to an asset draft before approving it. The more reviewers, the greater the number of potential iterations before all stakeholders agree on a final variant.   

* **Support for creative integrity**. Approvals safeguard the creative integrity of your brand assets by keeping content creators involved in the approval process. By involving creative stakeholders (for example, content creators and creative directors) in the review and approval process, you ensure that final output aligns with your vision and brand identity.

* **Adherence to Campaign goals and legal requirements**. The approval process helps verify that content supports campaign goals. It ensures that content meets legal authenticity, which minimizes risks and potential legal issues.

## Who can request a review or approve content?

If you have created an asset or experience, you can ask others in your organization's approval chain to formally review and comment on your work. Only these designated approvers can review the draft. 

## About GenStudio [!DNL Content] drafts 

_Drafts_ are preliminary versions of assets or experiences that have not undergone the review and approval process. Draft status identifies where the draft is in the review and approval process. A unique draft ID identifies each draft. THis ID is valid until a draft is approved and published to [!DNL Content]. Review comments and approvals for a draft are associated with this individual draft ID.

When a draft completes the review and approval process and is published to [!DNL Content], the draft ID expires, and GenStudio does not save associated comments and approval statuses. The draft URL is no longer valid.

### [!DNL Content] draft status

Draft status captures the state of the content draft as it moves through the review and approval process. All designated reviewers are notified of changes in the status of content that they are reviewing. Reviewers change draft status to indicate whether a draft needs further revision or can be approved.

Available draft statuses:

**Notified**: Content creator has started the review process by notifying reviewers that a draft is ready for review.
**Needs work**: Indicates that one or more reviewers has requested changes to the content draft. Content in this status cannot be saved to [!DNL Content].
**Approved**: All designated approvers have approved the asset or experience. The content creator can now add metadata to the asset or experience and save it to [!DNL Content].

## Notifications

GenStudio's in-product notifications update approvers and content creators in real time of asset status changes and review comments. Notifications support speedy iteration through the multiple review, edit, and approval cycles.

Actions taken by approval participants trigger automatic in-product notifications and email notifications. When you start an approval process, designated approvers receive both email and in-product notifications. You are kept in the loop with in-product notifications whenever an approver adds comments or approves. Notifications include links to the content draft.

If you initiated the review and approval process for content, you are notified of all approvals and review comments. However, approvers are notified of only comments that include them with an `@mention`.
