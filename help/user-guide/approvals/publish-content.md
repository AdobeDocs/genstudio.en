# Publish approved content

The final stage of creating brand-aligned, approved content is saving it to [!DNL Content] with appropriate metadata. You (the content creator) must finalize the approved asset by publishing, or saving it, to [!DNL Content].

## Approved content

When all designated reviewers approve a draft, GenStudio changes the draft status to **Approved**. This change in status launches the Publish process by alerting the content creator to the draft's approved status with the **Approved variants ready to publish** pop-up message and email. 

You can then finalize the draft by saving it to [!DNL Content] with appropriate metadata. The approved draft is not available to other GenStudio users until you publish the draft to content.

**To publish approved content**:

1. Access the approved draft from either the approval notification email or the **Approved variants ready to publish** pop-up message. This pop-up message includes a **Close** button to postpone publication of the approved asset and a **Publish** button to start the publication process.

1. Click **Publish** to save the asset or experience to [!DNL Content]. GenStudio displays the **Confirm details for your approved content** window, which displays thumbnails of the approved assets. GenStudio then prompts you to add relevant information about the asset or experience. This information is saved as metadata that adds value to [!DNL Content] filter and search operations. You can add the asset to a GenStudio Campaign at this point in the publication process. 

1. After the content publication process has completed, GenStudio displays the **Approved variations have been published** popup. From this popup widnow, take one of these two actions:

   * Click **Open in Content** to view the published asset or experience.
   
   or
   
   * Click **Create something new** to create new content.

## After publication

All GenStudio users can access approved assets or experiences in [!DNL Content]. The Asset details pane identifies the asset's upload and approval history. Saved content is identified by these attributes:

* **date** and **username**. Identifies the date that the content was uploaded or created in the GenStudio canvas. **username** identifies the content creator.

* **approved** and **username**. Identifies the date of approval and name of the final approver.

Draft URLs are invalid after a draft asset or experience are saved to [!DNL Content].
