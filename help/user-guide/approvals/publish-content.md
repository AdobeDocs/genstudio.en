# Publish approved content

The final stage of creating brand-aligned, approved content is saving it to Content with appropriate metadata. You (the content creator) must finalize the approved asset by publishing, or saving it, to Content.

Draft status changes to **Approved** when all designated reviewers have approved it. Once in-product notifications alert the content creator that an asset has been approved. The draft is then ready to be finalized, or saved to Content with appropriate metadata.

To publish approved content: 

Access the approved draft from either the approval notification email or the in-app notification. 

Click Publish to save the asset or experience to Content. GenStudio then prompts you to add relevant information about the asset or experience. This information is saved as metadata that adds value to Content filter and search operations.

Draft URLs are invalid after a draft asset or experience has been saved to Content.

## After publication

All GenStudio users can access approved assets or experiences that have been saved in Content.

Saved content is identified by these attributes:

date and username. Identifies the date that the content was uploaded or created in the GenStudio canvas. user name identifies the content creator.

approved and username. date of approval. username identifies the final approver.
