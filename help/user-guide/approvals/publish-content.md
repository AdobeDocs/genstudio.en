# Publish approved content

The final stage of creating brand-aligned, approved content is saving it to [!DNL Content] with appropriate metadata. You (the content creator) must finalize the approved asset by publishing, or saving it, to [!DNL Content].

When all designated reviewers approve a draft, GenStudio changes the draft status to **Approved**. This change in status launches the publishing process.  GenStudio displays the _Approved variants ready to publish_ pop-up on the creator's Canvas and sends notification email. 

You can then finalize the draft by saving it to [!DNL Content] with appropriate metadata. The approved draft is not available to other GenStudio users until you publish the draft to [!DNL Content].

**To publish approved content**:

1. Access the approved draft from either the approval notification email or the _Approved variants ready to publish_ pop-up. This pop-up includes a **[!UICONTROL Close]** button to postpone publication of the approved asset and a **[!UICONTROL Publish]** button to start the publication process.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Publish]** to save the asset or experience to [!DNL Content]. GenStudio displays the _Confirm details for your approved content_ window, which displays thumbnails of the approved assets. 

1. Add information about the content as prompted by GenStudio. This information is saved as metadata, which adds value to [!DNL Content] filter and search operations. You can add the asset to a GenStudio Campaign at this point in the publication process.

1. After the content publication process has completed, GenStudio displays the _Approved variations have been published_ popup. From this popup window, you can:

   * Click **[!UICONTROL Open in Content]** to view the published asset or experience

   * Click **[!UICONTROL Create something new]** to create new content.

## After publication

All GenStudio users can access approved assets or experiences in [!DNL Content]. The Asset details pane identifies the asset's upload and approval history These attributes identify saved content:

* **Upload date**: Identifies the date that the content was uploaded.
* **Uploaded by**: Identifies the GenStudio asset creator.

Draft URLs are invalid after a draft asset or experience is saved to [!DNL Content].
