# Publish approved content

The final stage of creating brand-aligned, approved content is saving it to Content with appropriate metadata. You (the content creator) must finalize the approved asset by publishing, or saving it, to [!DNL Content].

Draft status changes to **Approved** when all designated reviewers approve it. In-product notifications alert the content creator that an asset has been approved. The draft is then ready to be finalized, or saved to [!DNL Content] with appropriate metadata.

**To publish approved content**:

1) Access the approved draft from either the approval notification email or the in-app notification.

2) Click Publish to save the asset or experience to [!DNL Content]. GenStudio then prompts you to add relevant information about the asset or experience. This information is saved as metadata that adds value to [!DNL Content] filter and search operations.

Draft URLs are invalid after a draft asset or experience are saved to [!DNL Content].

## After publication

All GenStudio users can access approved assets or experiences that are saved in [!DNL Content].

Saved content is identified by these attributes:

* date and username. Identifies the date that the content was uploaded or created in the GenStudio canvas. user name identifies the content creator.

* approved and username. date of approval. username identifies the final approver.
