# Publish approved content

The final stage of creating brand-aligned, approved content is saving it to [!DNL Content] with appropriate metadata. You (the content creator) can finalize the approved asset by publishing, or saving it, to [!DNL Content].

When all designated approvers approve a draft, draft status changes to **Approved**. GenStudio for Performance Marketing displays the _Approved variants ready to publish_ pop-up on the creator's Canvas.

You can then finalize the draft by publishing it to [!DNL Content] with appropriate metadata. The approved draft is not available to other GenStudio users until you publish the draft to [!DNL Content].

**To publish approved content**:

1. Access the approved draft directly or from the _Approved variants ready to publish_ pop-up. This pop-up includes a **[!UICONTROL Close]** button to postpone publication of the approved asset and a **[!UICONTROL Publish]** button to start the publication process.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Publish]** to save the asset or experience to [!DNL Content]. GenStudio for Performance Marketing displays the _Confirm details for your approved content_ window, which displays thumbnails of the approved assets. 

1. Add information about the content as prompted by GenStudio. This information is saved as metadata, which adds value to [!DNL Content] filter and search operations. You can add the asset to a GenStudio campaign at this point in the publication process.

1. After the content publication process has completed, GenStudio displays the _Approved variations have been published_ popup. From this popup window, you can:

   * Click **[!UICONTROL Open in Content]** to view the published asset or experience.

   * Click **[!UICONTROL Create something new]** to create new content.

## After publication

All GenStudio for Performance Marketing users can access approved assets or experiences in [!DNL Content]. The Asset details panel identifies the asset's upload and approval history. These attributes identify saved content:

* **[!UICONTROL Created by]**: Identifies the GenStudio user who uploaded the asset or experience.
* **[!UICONTROL Approval History]**: Describes the most recent approval action for this asset.
* **[!UICONTROL Approved on date by Approver]**: Identifies the approval date and time and the approver. 

Draft URLs are invalid after a draft asset or experience is saved to [!DNL Content].
