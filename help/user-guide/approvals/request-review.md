# Request review and approval of content

Ready to invite your coworkers to review an asset or experience that you created? You can invite stakeholders to contribute feedback on a draft of your content with the eventual goal of approval.

Only reviewers who have been asked to review the content draft are able to view it. 

## Launch an approval request

After you have generated your content variants, you can request review and approval. 

**Request review**:

1. Click the **Send for approval** button on the top menu bar of the Canvas. The **Send for approval** pop up opens, identifying the draft you are requesting a review on. 

1. Select the approver or approvers you would like to request a review from. As you begin typing, the **Approver** field autocompletes the approver user name from the list of GenStudio users with Gen Studio view and approve permissions. The **Send** button is activated after you have entered at least one approver name.

1. Click **Send**. Clicking this button triggers in-product and email notifications that alert each designated approver that they have content to review.

Optional: Add comments to guide reviewer focus to particular features of the draft

Draft status is automatically assigned the **Active** status, which indicates that the review and approval process for this draft has begun.

## Add and remove approvers from the approval workflow

If you are the content creator, your draft Canvas includes a **Manage approvals** button. Use this button to remove or add approvers mid-way through the review and approval process.

Approver names are listed on this pane with a Notified status after the approval requests have launched.
