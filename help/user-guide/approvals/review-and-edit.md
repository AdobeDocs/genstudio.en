# Review and edit content

Review and approval processes that involve multiple reviewers can be time-consuming. The cycle of reviewing content, revising content in response to review comments, then reviewing changed content again can repeat many times. 

Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing generative AI capabilities accelerate these critical iterative phases of the content creation and review process. Content creators can respond to reviewer requests by using prompting capabilities to edit drafts quickly. The more reviewers and review cycles that content development requires, the greater the advantages that GenStudio for Performance Marketing brings.

## Iterative draft editing

Editors can make in-process edits to content in response to review comments. While a draft is under revision, approvers can continue adding review comments but cannot change asset status. The editor can continue editing content on the Canvas while approvers continue their reviews.

## View approval requests

As a designated approver, you can access the content that you are asked to review and approve in several ways:

* **Access the draft for review directly from the draft link in the approval request**. Click the draft link in either the approval request email notification or in-product notification.  The Canvas that displays the asset or experience opens. The _Approval_ panel is displayed on the right. 

* **Access the draft for review from the list of approval requests**. If you are asked to review multiple content drafts, your notification email includes a **[!UICONTROL View all notifications]** button. Click this button to navigate to a page that displays all the notifications that you have received, including approval requests and notifications that you have enabled from other Adobe Experience Cloud products.

## Access content for review

You can approve content if you have received an email requesting your review and approval of an asset or experience. This email contains a link to the draft you have been asked to review. This URL is valid only while the draft is under review.

**To review content**:

1. Use the link in your in-production notification or email to navigate to the content for review. The Canvas opens.

1. The Canvas includes a **[!UICONTROL Review & Approve]** button on the upper right. Click this button to open the _Approvals_ panel for this asset.

## Request changes

You can list suggested changes or ask questions about the draft from the Content  _Approval_ panel. The **Needs work** draft status notifies the content creator that changes are requested.

This process of reviewing, suggesting edits to the content creator, and then revising the content and optionally requesting additional input via `@mention` comments is highly iterative. It is in this part of the cycle that you see the time-saving abilities of GenStudio for Performance Marketing.

**To request changes**:

1. Set draft status to **Needs work**. 
1. Enter comments and recommended changes in the **Comments** field and click **[!UICONTROL Submit]**. All reviewers and the content creator can view these comments.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Review & Approve]** and assign **Needs work**. This triggers email and in-product notifications to the content creator.

The content creator can continue their edits while receiving and responding to incoming review comments.

## Manage approvals

If you are the content creator, your draft Canvas includes the **[!UICONTROL Manage approvals]** button. Use this button to remove or add approvers throughout the review and approval process.
