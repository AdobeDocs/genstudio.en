# Review and edit content

Review and approval processes that involve multiple reviewers can be time-consuming. The cycle of reviewing content, revising content in response to review comments, then reviewing changed content typically repeats many times. 

GenStudio's generative AI capabilities accelerate critical phases of the content creation and review process. Content creators can respond to reviewer requests by using prompting capabilities to quickly edit drafts. In-product notifications immediately notify reviewers that the draft has been revised and can review changes. The more reviewers and review cycles that content development requires, the greater the advantages that GenStudio brings.

## Add comments to a review


## Request changes to content

Enter comments and suggestions in the xxx pane. 

Set draft status to **Needs work**. 

## Iterative draft editing

Creators can make in-process edits to content in response to review comments. When you save your draft changes, all designated approvers are notified of the draft change. While a draft is being editing, reviewers can continue adding review comments but cannot change asset status. The content creator can continue editing content on the canvas while reviewers continue their review.

In-product notifications keep both reviewers and content creators updated on any draft changes.
