# Review and edit content

Review and approval processes that involve multiple reviewers can be time-consuming. The cycle of reviewing content, revising content in response to review comments, then reviewing changed content typically repeats many times. 

GenStudio's generative AI capabilities accelerate these critical iterative phases of the content creation and review process. Content creators can respond to reviewer requests by using prompting capabilities to quickly edit drafts. In-product notifications immediately notify reviewers that the draft has been revised and can review changes. The more reviewers and review cycles that content development requires, the greater the advantages that GenStudio brings.

## Iterative draft editing

Creators can make in-process edits to content in response to review comments. When you save your draft changes, all designated approvers are notified of the draft change. While a draft is under edit, reviewers can continue adding review comments but cannot change asset status. You (the content creator) can continue editing content on the canvas while approvers continue their reviews.

In-product notifications keep both reviewers and content creators immediately updated on any draft changes.

## View approval requests

As a designated approver, you can access the content you have been asked to review and approve in several ways:

* **Access the draft for review directly from the draft link in the approval request**. Click the draft link in either the approval request email notification or in-product notification. GenStudio opens a canvas that displays the asset or experience. The Asset details left pane includes an Approval pane. 

* **Access the draft for review from the list of approval requests**. If you have been asked to review multiple content drafts, your notification email includes a **View all notifications** button. Click this button to navigate to a page that displays all your pending review requests.

## Access content for review

**Review content**:

1. Use the link in your in-production notification or request email to navigate to the content for review. GenStudio displays the GenStudio canvas that displays this content.

1. The asset canvas includes a **Review & Approve** button on the upper right. Click this button to open the Approvals pane for this asset.

## Request changes to content

You can list suggested changes or ask questions about the draft from the content's Approval pane. The **Needs work** draft status will alert all reviewers and the content creator that changes have been requested.

This process of reviewing, suggesting edits to the content creator, and then revising the content and re-sending for approval is highly iterative. It is in this part of the cycle that the time-saving abilities of GenStudio are highlighted. 

**Request changes**

1. Set draft status to **Needs work**. 
1. Enter comments and recommended changes in the **Comments** field and click **Submit**. All reviewers and the content creator can view these comments.
1. Click **Review & Approve** and assign **Needs work**. This triggers email and in-product notifications to the content creator.

The content creator can continue their edits while receiving and responding to incoming review comments.

## Manage approvals

If you are the content creator, your draft Canvas includes a **Manage approvals** button. Use this button to remove or add approvers mid-way through the review and approval process.
