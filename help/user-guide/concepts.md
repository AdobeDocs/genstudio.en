# Introduction to GenStudio

GenStudio is a standalone enterprise product that embodies Adobe's content supply chain to streamline marketing campaigns. It is challenging to build personalized, brand-approved content at scale, monitor effectiveness, and adapt quickly to the ever-changing market. GenStudio brings Creative Cloud and Experience Cloud together in one application that leverages generative AI as a performance multiplier for enterprise marketing teams.

With GenStudio you can:

- Create on-brand content using natural language prompts
- Generate variants to personalize across channels or freshen an ongoing campaign
- Evaluate content performance with insights about campaigns and content attributes

## Generative AI technology

GenStudio harnesses the power of generative AI to accelerate the content creation process and ensure high-quality content generation. The iterative lifecycle of your creative assets results in increasingly accurate and brand-aligned content that resonates with your target audience.

Begin by effectively training GenStudio on your organization's branding, customer personas, and product descriptions through the powerful brand guidelines feature. See the [Brand references overview](../user-guide/references/overview.md) to learn how to prepare and upload these guidelines.

## GenStudio Content lifecycle

The demand is high for quality experiences in multiple channels at a faster pace. GenStudio simplifies the content supply chain into a well-organized workflow for marketers. GenStudio leverages Adobe technology at each stage of the lifecycle.
