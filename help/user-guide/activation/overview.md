# GenStudio Activation

_Activation_ is the process of making GenStudio-generated assets and experiences available for delivery through your select channels and Adobe Experience Cloud products. You can easily export approved content from GenStudio in the optimal formats for the third-party applications you have included in Products.

The GenStudio activation feature is natively integrated into Adobe's experience delivery products: Journey Optimizer, Journey Optimizer B2B edition, Experience Manager, Marketo, and Target.

**To activate an approved asset**:

1. Select the asset from [!DNL Content].

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Download]** button on the asset's Details pane. GenStudio begins the download process. 

The asset is downloaded as an zip file to your local Downloads folder.

**To activate an approved experience**:

1. Select the experience from [!DNL Content]. 

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Export for activation]** button on the experience's Details pane. GenStudio displays the **[!UICONTROL Export for activation]** popup and provides two download formats: CSV and HTML.

1. Select your preferred download format by clicking the **[!UICONTROL Export CVS]** or **[!UICONTROL Export HTML]** button on the popup.

The export process creates a ZIP package in your local _Downloads_ folder. This folder name is the same as the GenStudio experience name.
